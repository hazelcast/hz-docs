== Step 1. Install Hazelcast

In this step, you install the Hazelcast
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-command-line[command line interface (CLI)^]: A development tool that allows you to start Hazelcast members and the Management Center with one command.

. To install the CLI, use one of the following package managers for your operating system:
+
[tabs] 
==== 
Mac:: 
+ 
--

To install the CLI on macOS, use the Homebrew package manager.

[source,bash]
----
brew tap hazelcast/hz
brew install hazelcast
----
--

Linux::
+
--

To install the CLI on Linux, you can use either of these package managers, depending on your Linux distribution:

.Debian
[source,shell]
----
wget -qO - https://repository.hazelcast.com/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://repository.hazelcast.com/debian stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install hazelcast
----

.RPM
[source,shell]
----
wget https://repository.hazelcast.com/rpm/hazelcast-rpm.repo -O hazelcast-rpm.repo
sudo mv hazelcast-rpm.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo yum install hazelcast
----
--
Windows::
+
--
At the moment, Hazelcast does not support any Windows package managers.

To get started with Hazelcast on Windows, see xref:install-hazelcast.adoc[] where you can get started with Docker, the binary distribution, or Java.
--
====

. Check that Hazelcast is installed.
+
[source,shell]
----
hz -V
----
+
You should see your installed versions of the CLI, Hazelcast, and Management Center:
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
CLI tool: {page-latest-cli}
Hazelcast: {page-component-version}
Hazelcast Management Center: {page-latest-supported-mc}
----

== Step 2. Start a Local Cluster

Hazelcast clusters consist of servers that we call members. These members communicate with each other to form a distributed network. It's these members that store and process your data.

. To start a standalone Hazelcast member, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
hz start
----
+
You should see the following in the console:
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
INFO: [192.168.1.164]:5701 [dev] [{page-component-version}] <1>

Members {size:1, ver:1} [ <2>
	Member [192.168.1.164]:5701 - 4221d540-e34e-4ff2-8ad3-41e060b895ce this
]
----
+
<1> The local IP address of your Hazelcast member followed by the default cluster name (dev) and the version of Hazelcast that you are running.
<2> The size of your cluster. Here, you just have one member, so the size is 1.

. To add one more member to the cluster, open another terminal window and run the `start` command again.
+
[source,shell]
----
hz start
----
+
The members
discover each other automatically and form a two-member cluster. You should see
the following in the console:
+
[source,shell]
----
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 - e40081de-056a-4ae5-8ffe-632caf8a6cf1 this
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 - 93e82109-16bf-4b16-9c87-f4a6d0873080
]
----

NOTE: These members use the default configuration, which is defined in the `hazelcast.xml` file. The location of this file is printed on the first line of
the output of the `start` command.

== Step 3. Connect the Management Center

Management Center is a user interface for managing and monitoring your cluster.

In this step, you start a local instance of Management Center and connect it to your cluster.

. To start Management Center, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
hz mc start
----

. In a web browser, go to localhost:8080 to open Managment Center.

. On the landing page of Management Center, enable dev mode.
+
image:mc-dev-mode.png[Enabling dev mode in Management center]

. Create a connection, using the default settings.
+
You should see that you cluster is in an active state and has a single member. An active cluster is stable and operating without restrictions.
+

== Step 4. Write Data to Memory

Hazelcast has lots of distributed data structures available for writing data to memory on your cluster. One of the most popular ways of writing data to memory is to use a distributed map. Maps store key/value pairs called entries, which are replicated and distributed across a cluster.

The quickest way to write some data to a map is to use the CLI console.

. To start the console, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
hz-cli console
----

. Enter the following to create a map and write some data to it:
+
- `ns my-distributed-map`
- `m.put "1" "John"`
- `m.put "2" "Mary"`
- `m.put "3" "Jane"`
+
You'll see that each of the `m.put` lines returns `null`, which means that the data was written to the map.

. In Management Center, go to *Storage* > *Maps*.
+.
You should see that your cluster has a map called `my-distributed-map` with three entries (keys and values). You'll also see the total amount of memory that those entries are taking up in your cluster.

== Next Steps

In this quickstart, you have learnt how to start a local cluster,
write data to it and visualize that data in Management Center. To continue your journey through Hazelcast, check the following resources:
