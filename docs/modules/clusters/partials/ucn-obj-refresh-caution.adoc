CAUTION: {ucn} can replace resources dynamically, but that does not affect the lifecycle of already existing instances of old classes.
That means that creation of new objects will use new resources (new bytecode), but older objects won't be removed and recreated; in this case a manual intervention is needed.
This caution applies especially to long-living objects, tied to a lifecycle of Hazelcast structures, such as `IMap`'s MapLoader`s: deploying new version won't replace already added MapLoader and if user needs to refresh such object, a cluster restart is needed.
