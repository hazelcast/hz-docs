= Deploying a Cluster on Amazon AWS
:description: Deploy Hazelcast clusters on Amazon AWS EC2 and AWS ECS/Fargate environments and allow them to discover each other automatically.

{description}

== Before you Begin

Before deploying Hazelcast on AWS, you must have the following:

* Linux Kernel 3.19+
+
WARNING: TCP connections may get stuck when used with older Kernel versions, resulting in undefined timeouts.

== Discovering Members Automatically

To make it easier to set up clusters on Amazon AWS, Hazelcast allows members to discover each other automatically, using discovery strategies.

When a member starts on AWS, it fetches a list of all running instances filtered by the member's AWS configuration settings. Then, each instance is checked one-by-one with its IP and each of the ports defined in the `hz-port` property (see the example configurations in this section for the property's description). When a member is discovered under `IP:PORT`, then it joins the cluster.

Choose from one of the following environments to configure a discovery strategy:

- <<ec2-configuration, EC2>>
- <<ecsfargate-configuration, ECS/Fargate>>
- <<ecs-environment-with-ec2-discovery, ECS/EC2>>
- <<aws-elastic-beanstalk, AWS Elastic Beanstalk>>

== Configuring Hazelcast for EC2

You can configure both Hazelcast members and Hazelcast clients to automatically discover clusters deployed in Amazon EC2.

=== EC2 Hazelcast Member Discovery

The following is an example AWS EC2 configuration snippet in a member, to enable automatic member discoveries in EC2. Each member of your cluster should have the same configuration.

<1> Multicast discovery strategy must be disabled. It is mandatory to set.
<2> AWS discovery strategy must be enabled. It is mandatory to set.
<3> Filter to look only for EC2 Instances with the given `tag-key`; comma-separated multiple values are supported, e.g., `KeyA,KeyB`; comma-separated values behave as `AND` conditions. It is mandatory to set.
<4> Filter to look only for EC2 Instances with the given `tag-value`; comma-separated multiple values are supported, e.g., `ValueA,ValueB`; comma-separated values behave as `AND` conditions. It is mandatory to set.


The following are the optional properties to be configured[[ec2_properties]]:

* `access-key`, `secret-key`: Access and secret keys of your AWS account; if not set, `iam-role` is used.
* `iam-role`: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html[IAM Role^] attached to the EC2 instance used to fetch credentials (if `access-key`/`secret-key` are not specified); if not set, the default IAM Role attached to the EC2 instance is used.
* `region`: Region where the Hazelcast members are running; default is the current region.
* `host-header`: `ec2`, `ecs`, or the URL of a EC2/ECS API endpoint; automatically detected by default.
* `security-group-name`: Filter to look only for the EC2 instances with the given security group.
* `connection-timeout-seconds`, `read-timeout-seconds`: Connection and read timeouts when making a call to the AWS API; its default is `10` seconds.
* `connection-retries`: Number of retries while connecting to AWS API; its default is `3`.
* `hz-port`: Range of ports where the discovery strategy looks for Hazelcast members; its default is `5701-5708`.

Note that if you don't specify any of the optional properties, then Hazelcast uses the IAM Role assigned to the EC2 Instance to form a cluster from all Hazelcast members running in the same region.

=== Client Discovery of EC2 Hazelcast Cluster

Hazelcast clients can automatically discover the Hazelcast cluster running in EC2 environment.
This section is for the Hazelcast Java clients. See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/v5.3.0/Reference_Manual.md#57-enabling-hazelcast-aws-discovery[{cpp} client] and https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-go-client-discovery[Go client] documentations to learn how to configure Hazelcast {cpp} and Go clients to automatically discover members running in EC2 environment.

- *Client running in EC2:*

To discover the Hazelcast cluster running on EC2 using the client running on EC2, you can use the same discovery parameters as mentioned in the previous section.

The following is an example configuration snippet in a Java client. Each client should have the same configuration.

```
--
====

- *Client running in ECS:*

To discover the Hazelcast cluster running on EC2 using the client running on ECS, you need to specify the needed <<ec2_properties,EC2 related properties>> (`iam-role`, `security-group-name`) and to set the `ec2:DescribeInstances` permission.
If none of the ECS or EC2 related properties are specified, the AWS discovery strategy tries to discover the ECS members. If none is found, then it tries to discover EC2 members.

The following is an example configuration snippet in a Java client. Each client should have the same configuration.

      .setProperty("tag-value", "my-ec2-instance-tag-value");
```

* *Client running outside AWS:*

For the Java clients running *outside AWS*, you always need to specify the following parameters:

- `access-key`, `secret-key` - IAM role cannot be used from outside AWS.
- `region` - it cannot be detected automatically.
- `use-public-ip` - must be set to `true`.

Note also that your EC2 instances must have a public IP assigned.

The following is an example configuration snippet.

== ECS/Fargate Configuration

The plugin works both for *Hazelcast Member Discovery* (forming Hazelcast cluster) and *Hazelcast Client Discovery*.

NOTE: For the detailed description, check out link:https://guides.hazelcast.org/ecs-embedded[Hazelcast Guides: Getting Started with Embedded Hazelcast on ECS].

=== ECS Hazelcast Member Discovery

Make sure that your IAM Task Role has the following permissions[[ecs_permissions]]:

* `ecs:ListTasks`
* `ecs:DescribeTasks`
* `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces` (needed only if task have public IPs)

Then, you can configure Hazelcast in one of the following manners. Please note that `10.0.*.*` value depends on your VPC CIDR block definition.

config.getNetworkConfig().getJoin().getAwsConfig().setEnabled(true);
config.getNetworkConfig().getInterfaces().setEnabled(true).addInterface("10.0.*.*");
```
--
====

The following optional properties can be configured[[ecs_properties]]:

* `access-key`, `secret-key`: access and secret keys of AWS your account; if not set, IAM Task Role is used
* `region`: region where Hazelcast members are running; default is the current region
* `cluster`: ECS cluster short name or ARN; default is the current cluster
* `family`: filter to look only for ECS tasks with the given family name; mutually exclusive with `service-name`
* `service-name`: filter to look only for ECS tasks from the given service; mutually exclusive with `family`
* `tag-key`, `tag-value`: filter to look only for ECS Tasks with the given `tag-key`/`tag-value`; comma-separated multiple values are supported, e.g., `KeyA,KeyB`; comma-separated values behave as AND conditions
* `host-header`: `ecs` or the URL of an ECS API endpoint; automatically detected by default
* `connection-timeout-seconds`, `read-timeout-seconds`: connection and read timeouts when making a call to AWS API; default to `10`
* `connection-retries`: number of retries while connecting to AWS API; default to `3`
* `hz-port`: a range of ports where the plugin looks for Hazelcast members; default is `5701-5708`

NOTE: If you don't specify any of the properties, then the plugin discovers all Hazelcast members running in the current ECS cluster.

NOTE: ECS discovery can use `IAM Role` assigned to the ECS Task instead of using `access-key`, `secret-key`.

=== Client Discovery of ECS Hazelcast Cluster

Hazelcast Client can automatically discover the Hazelcast cluster running in ECS environment.

* *Client running in ECS:*

To discover the Hazelcast Cluster running on ECS using the client running on the ECS, use the same discovery parameters as mentioned above.

Following are example declarative and programmatic configuration snippets.

      .setEnabled(true);
```

* *Client running in EC2:*

Hazelcast Client on EC2 instances can discover the members running on ECS. For this you need to specify the needed <<ecs_properties,ECS related properties>> (`cluster`, `family`, `service-name`) and make sure to set the `ec2:DescribeInstances` permission.
If none of the ECS or EC2 related properties are specified, the AWS discovery tries to discover the EC2 members. If none is found, then it tries to discover ECS members.

Following are example declarative and programmatic configuration snippets.

      .setProperty("service-name", "my-ecs-service");
```
--
====

* *Client running outside AWS:*

If Hazelcast Client runs *outside AWS*, then you need to always specify the following parameters:

- `access-key`, `secret-key` - IAM role cannot be used from outside AWS
- `region` - it cannot be detected automatically
- `cluster` - it cannot be detected automatically
- `use-public-ip` - must be set to `true`

NOTE: Your ECS Tasks must have public IPs assigned and your IAM Task Role must have `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces` permission.

Following are example declarative and programmatic configuration snippets.

      .setProperty("region", "eu-central-1")
      .setProperty("cluster", "my-cluster")
      .setProperty("use-public-ip", "true");
```

* *Client running on Lambda:*

Hazelcast Clients launched on Lambda functions can discover the members running on ECS in the same way as connecting outside of AWS. Since the Lambda function does not provide the Metadata API at execution time, the required properties cannot be inferred by the Discovery Plugin. That is why you must declare all the necessary properties in the Hazelcast Client configuration.

- `access-key`, `secret-key` - IAM role cannot be used in Lambda function
- `region` - it cannot be detected automatically
- `cluster` - it cannot be detected automatically
- `use-public-ip` - must be set to `true`

NOTE: The access and secret keys generated for a session are not allowed for use in Discovery Plugins. Instead, you should use the Access and Secret keys generated from the persistent IAM Role.

The following example demonstrates how to establish a connection to a Hazelcast Cluster in a Lambda function.

That is the `hazelcast-client.yaml` file located within the JAR file of the Lambda function.

```yaml
hazelcast-client:
  network:
    aws:
      enabled: true
      access-key: my-access-key
      secret-key: my-secret-key
      region: ca-central-1
      cluster: my-cluster
      hz-port: 5701
      use-public-ip: true
```

This is the simple Lambda handler in Java, which creates a Hazelcast Client by loading the given configuration file above.

```java
// Handler value: example.HazelcastClientHandler
public class HazelcastClientHandler implements RequestHandler<Map<String, String>, Void> {

    @Override
    public Void handleRequest(Map<String, String> input, Context context) {
        var clientConfig = ClientConfig.load();
        var hz = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);

        // ---snip---

        return null;
    }
}
```

== ECS Environment with EC2 Discovery

If you use ECS on EC2 instances (not Fargate), you may also set up your ECS Tasks to use `host` network mode and then use EC2 discovery mode instead of ECS. In that case, your Hazelcast configuration would look as follows.

```yaml
hazelcast:
  network:
    join:
      multicast:
        enabled: false
      aws:
        enabled: true
        host-header: ec2
    interfaces:
      enabled: true
      interfaces:
        - 10.0.*.*
```

All other parameters can be used exactly the same as described in the EC2-related section.

== Enabling IMDSv2 for EC2 Instances

Hazelcast automatically handles the usage of IMDSv2 method to access instance metadata, provided that your EC2 instance is configured accordingly:

. Enable IMDSv2 on the instances you have; see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-existing-instances.html[AWS documentation] on how to do that.
. Start Hazelcast with AWS auto-discovery enabled as explained in <<ec2-hazelcast-member-discovery, EC2 Hazelcast Member Discovery>>.

== AWS Elastic Beanstalk

While deploying your application into the Java Platform, please make sure your Elastic Beanstalk Environment Configuration satisfies the following requirements:

* EC2 security groups contain a group which allows the port `5701`
* IAM instance profile contains IAM role which has `ec2:DescribeInstances` permission (or your Hazelcast configuration contains `access-key` and `secret-key`)
* Deployment policy is `Rolling` (instead of the default `All at once` which may cause the whole Hazelcast members to restart at the same time and therefore lose data)

== Preventing Data Loss

By default, Hazelcast distributes partition replicas (backups) randomly and equally among cluster members. However, this is not safe in terms of high availability when a partition and its replicas are stored on the same rack, using the same network, or power source. To deal with that, Hazelcast offers logical partition grouping, so that a partition
itself and its backups would not be stored within the same group. This way Hazelcast guarantees that a possible failure
affecting more than one member at a time will not cause data loss. For more details about partition groups, see xref:clusters:partition-group-configuration.adoc[Partition Group Configuration].

In addition to two built-in grouping options `ZONE_AWARE` and `PLACEMENT_AWARE`, you can customize the formation of
these groups based on the network interfaces of members. For more details about custom groups, see
xref:clusters:partition-group-configuration.adoc[Custom Partition Groups].

=== Multi-Zone Deployments

If `ZONE_AWARE` partition group is enabled, the backups of a partition are always stored in a different availability
zone. Hazelcast supports the `ZONE_AWARE` feature for both EC2 and ECS.

NOTE: When using the `ZONE_AWARE` partition grouping, a cluster spanning multiple Availability Zones (AZ) should have an equal number of members in each AZ. Otherwise, it will result in uneven partition distribution among
the members.

=== Partition Placement Group Deployments

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-partition[AWS Partition Placement Group]
(PPG) ensures low latency between the instances in the same partition of a placement group
and also provides availability since no two partitions share the same underlying hardware. As long as the partitions of a 
PPG contain an equal number of instances, it will be good practice for Hazelcast clusters formed within a single zone.

If EC2 instances belong to a PPG and `PLACEMENT_AWARE` partition group is enabled, then Hazelcast members will be grouped
by the partitions of the PPG. For instance, the Hazelcast members in the first partition of a PPG named `ppg` will belong
to the partition group of `ppg-1`, and those in the second partition will belong to `ppg-2` and so on. Furthermore, these
groups will be specific to each availability zone. That is, they are formed with zone names as well: `us-east-1-ppg-1`,
`us-east-2-ppg-1`, and the like. However, if a Hazelcast cluster spans multiple availability zones then you should
consider using `ZONE_AWARE`.

=== Cluster Placement Group Deployments

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-cluster[AWS Cluster Placement Group]
(CPG) ensures low latency by packing instances close together inside an availability zone.
If you favor latency over availability, then CPG will serve your purpose.

NOTE: In the case of CPG, using `PLACEMENT_AWARE` has no effect, so can use the default Hazelcast partition group
strategy.

=== Spread Placement Group Deployments

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-spread[AWS Spread Placement Groups]
(SPG) ensures high availability in a single zone by placing each instance in a group on a
distinct rack. It provides better latency than multi-zone deployment, but worse than Cluster Placement Group. SPG is
limited to 7 instances, so if you need a larger Hazelcast cluster within a single zone, you should use PPG instead.

NOTE: In the case of SPG, using `PLACEMENT_AWARE` has no effect, so can use the default Hazelcast partition group
strategy.

== Autoscaling

Hazelcast is prepared to work correctly within the autoscaling environments. Note that there are two specific requirements to prevent Hazelcast from losing data:

* The number of members in a cluster must not change by more than one at a time
* When a member is launched or terminated, the cluster must be in a safe state

Read about details in the blog post: link:https://hazelcast.com/blog/aws-auto-scaling-with-hazelcast/?utm_source=docs-website[AWS Auto Scaling with Hazelcast].
