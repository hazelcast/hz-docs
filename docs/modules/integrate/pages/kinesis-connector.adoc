= Amazon Kinesis Connector

link:https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/[Amazon Kinesis Data Streams] (KDS) is a
massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. All
data items passing through it, called _records_, are assigned a
_partition key_. As the name suggests, partition keys group related
records together. Records with the same partition key are also ordered.
Partition keys are grouped into _shards_, the base throughput unit of
KDS. The input and output rates of shards is limited. Streams can be
resharded at any time.

To read from Kinesis, the only requirement is to provide a KDS stream
name. (Kinesis does not handle deserialization itself, it only provides
serialized binary data.)

```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(KinesisSources.kinesis(STREAM).build())
  .withNativeTimestamps(0)
  .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
```

The shards are distributed across the Hazelcast cluster, so that each node is
responsible for reading a subset of the partition keys.

When used as a sink, in order to be able to write out any type of data
items, the requirements are: KDS stream name, key function (specifies
how to compute the partition key from an input item), and the value
function (specifies how to compute the data blob from an input item -
the serialization).

```java
FunctionEx<Log, String> keyFn = l -> l.service();
FunctionEx<Log, byte[]> valueFn = l -> l.message().getBytes();
Sink<Log> sink = KinesisSinks.kinesis("stream", keyFn, valueFn).build();

p.readFrom(Sources.files("home/logs")) //read lines of text from log files
 .map(line -> LogParser.parse(line))   //parse lines into Log data objects
 .writeTo(sink);                       //write Log objects out to Kinesis
```

To use the Kinesis connectors, make sure the
`hazelcast-jet-kinesis` module is present in the `lib` directory
and add the following dependency to your application:

== Fault-tolerance

Amazon Kinesis persists the data and it's possible to replay it (on a
per-shard basis). This enables fault tolerance. If a job has a
processing guarantee configured, then Hazelcast will periodically save the
current shard offsets and then replay from the saved offsets when the
job is restarted. If no processing guarantee is enabled, the source will
start reading from the oldest available data, determined by the KDS
retention period (defaults to 24 hours, can be as long as 365 days).

While the source is suitable for both at-least-once and exactly-once
pipelines, the only processing guarantee the sink can support is
at-least-once. This is caused by the lack of transaction support in
Kinesis (can't write data into it with transactional guarantees) and the
AWS SDK occasionally causing data duplication on its own (see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-record-processor-duplicates.html#kinesis-record-processor-duplicates-producer[Producer Retries]
in the documentation).

== Ordering

As stated before, Kinesis preserves the order of records with the same
partition key (or, more generally, the order of records belonging to the
same shard). However, neither the source nor the sink can fully uphold
this guarantee.

The problem scenario for the source is resharding. Resharding is the
process of adjusting the number of shards of a stream to adapt to data
flow rate changes. It is done voluntarily and explicitly by the stream's
owner, and it does not interrupt the flow of data through the stream.
During resharding, some (old) shards get closed, and new ones are
created - some partition keys transition from an old shard to a new one.
To keep the ordering for such a partition key in transit, Hazelcast would need
to make sure that it finishes reading all the data from the old shard
before starting to read data from the new one. Hazelcast would also need to
ensure that the new shard's data can't possibly overtake the old ones
data inside the pipeline. Currently, Hazelcast does not have a mechanism
to ensure this for such a distributed source. It's best to schedule
resharding when there are lulls in the data flow. Watermarks might also
manifest unexpected behaviour, if data is flowing during resharding.

The problem scenario for the sink is the ingestion data rate of a shard
being tripped. A KDS shard has an ingestion rate of 1MiB per second. If
you try to write more into it, then some records will be rejected. This
rejection breaks the ordering because the sinks write data in batches,
and the shards don't just reject entire batches, but random items from
them. What's rejected can (and is) retried, but the batch's original
ordering can't be preserved. The sink can't entirely avoid all
rejections because it's distributed, multiple instances of it write into
the same shard, and coordinating an aggregated rate among them is not
something currently possible in Hazelcast and there can be also others sending
to the same stream. Truth be told, though, Kinesis also only preserves
the order of successfully ingested records, not the order in which
ingestion was attempted. Having enough shards and properly spreading out
partition keys should prevent the problem from happening.
