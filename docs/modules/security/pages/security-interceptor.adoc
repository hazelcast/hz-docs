= Security Interceptor
:page-enterprise: true

Hazelcast allows you to intercept every remote operation executed
by the client. This lets you add a very flexible custom security logic.
To do this, implement `com.hazelcast.security.SecurityInterceptor`.

----

The `before` method is called before processing the request on the
remote server. The `after` method is called after the processing.
Exceptions thrown while executing the `before` method are propagated
to the client, but exceptions thrown while executing the `after` method
are suppressed.

NOTE: `AccessControlException` has been deprecated as of Java 17. There
is no current planned removal date from Oracle,  nor is  there an
appropriate replacement available. This exception will be replaced in a
future major release of Hazelcast.
