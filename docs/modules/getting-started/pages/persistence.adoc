= Persist Map Entries on Disk
:description: This tutorial introduces you to Hazelcast with Persistence enabled. At the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to enable Persistence for a map in your cluster and see the recovery of the map entries after a cluster shutdown.
:page-enterprise: true

{description}

Map entries in Hazelcast are usually stored in-memory (RAM) which
makes it volatile, so any data in the map is lost when either too many members fail or the whole
cluster is shut down. To recover data when the cluster is restarted, you
can use Hazelcast's Persistence feature to persist data on disk.

In this tutorial, you will complete the following steps:

. Start a Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} cluster with three members and Persistence enabled.
. Create a map with data in it.
. Shut down the whole cluster to simulate a graceful shutdown, such as for maintenance purposes.
. Restart the cluster and see that the map entries are restored from disk and put back in memory.

== Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Prerequisites|Useful resources

|Docker image for Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} and an {enterprise-product-name} license
|xref:getting-started:enterprise-overview.adoc[]

|Docker network with the name `hazelcast-network`
|Use the `docker network create hazelcast-network` command 

|===

== Step 1. Start a member with persistence enabled

You'll start the first member in a cluster called `hello-world`. Run the following Docker command:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    --name first-member --network hazelcast-network \
    --rm \
    -e HZ_NETWORK_PUBLICADDRESS=host.docker.internal:5701 \ <1>
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=hello-world \
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your_license_key> \ <2>
    -e HZ_PERSISTENCE_ENABLED=true \ <3>
    -e HZ_MAP_MYDISTRIBUTEDMAP_DATAPERSISTENCE_ENABLED=true \ <4>
    -v ~/persist:/opt/hazelcast/persistence \ <5>
    -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{ee-version} <6>
----
<1> You can replace `host.docker.internal` with the IP address of your Docker host; either will work but you will need to know the IP address for connecting, for example, a SQL client to a specific member.
// Some examples do same IP address but different ports - does this also work?
<2> Replace the `<your_license_key>` placeholder with your Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} license key.
<3> Enables persistence for the member.
<4> Enables persistence for the map.
<5> By default, Hazelcast creates the `/opt/hazelcast/persistence` directory to store the persisted data.
However, using a Docker image, you cannot create any files inside the container. This line of the command mounts a directory
on your local to the container, which in this case is `persist` under the home directory. This way, the container will use this local
directory to save the persisted data. You need to define a separate persist mapping for each member e.g. the second member example uses `~/persist2`.
<6> The first port number should match the port assigned in <1>. For subsuequent members (e.g. second, third) you should increment the first port number but keep the second port number i.e. 5702:5701, 5703:5701.

NOTE: The `HZ_MAP_MYDISTRIBUTEDMAP_DATAPERSISTENCE_ENABLED=true` command enables persistence for a map called `mydistributedmap`.
We recommend providing the configuration for a data structure, in this case a map, before it is created.
This way, the map will have the correct configuration on creation, which you'll perform in Step 3 below.

Your first member is started now, and you can see from the terminal logs that persistence is enabled:

[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
[ INFO] [main] [c.h.i.c.o.ExternalConfigurationOverride]: Detected external configuration entries in environment variables: [*hazelcast.persistence.enabled=true*,hazelcast.clustername=hello-world,hazelcast.licensekey=******,hazelcast.map.mydistributedmap.datapersistence.enabled=true]
[ INFO] [main] [c.h.i.h.HotRestartIntegrationService]: [LOCAL] [hello-world] [{full-version}] Created new empty hot-restart directory: /opt/hazelcast/persistence/611ffa80-b653-44b9-8cf1-f9ffa5bfa1cb
[ INFO] [main] [c.h.s.logo]: [172.18.0.2]:5701 [hello-world] [{full-version}]
----
 
== Step 2. Start more members

Run each of the following Docker commands in a separate terminal.

Replace the `<your_license_key>` placeholders with your Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} license key.

.Command to start a second member.
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    --name second-member --network hazelcast-network \
    --rm \
    -e HZ_NETWORK_PUBLICADDRESS=host.docker.internal:5702 \
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=hello-world \
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your_license_key> \
    -e HZ_PERSISTENCE_ENABLED=true \
    -e HZ_MAP_MYDISTRIBUTEDMAP_DATAPERSISTENCE_ENABLED=true \
    -v ~/persist:/opt/hazelcast/persistence \
    -p 5702:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{ee-version}
----

.Command to start a third member.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    --name third-member --network hazelcast-network \
    --rm \
    -e HZ_NETWORK_PUBLICADDRESS=host.docker.internal:5703 \
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=hello-world \
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your_license_key> \
    -e HZ_PERSISTENCE_ENABLED=true \
    -e HZ_MAP_MYDISTRIBUTEDMAP_DATAPERSISTENCE_ENABLED=true \
    -v ~/persist:/opt/hazelcast/persistence \
    -p 5703:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{ee-version}
----

You should now see all three members forming a cluster:

[source,shell]
----
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
	Member [host.docker.internal]:5701 - d1917f97-49b4-4e8e-b8df-ab541c6c681b this  <1>
	Member [host.docker.internal]:5702 - ed7d90a0-1819-40fc-a0fb-da64a43d9269
	Member [host.docker.internal]:5703 - a7f2f072-cb1f-4c15-88b3-6dbefa212bb0
]
----
<1> The *this* label at the end of the line indicates the current member i.e. this examples shows logs from the first member's perspective.

Note the member IP addresses and ports since you will need them in the following steps.
// need best reliable way of doing this - you can see in the terminal and the hint should be around 172.18.0.2 etc.
// can you get this from MC? Why not?!?
// kubectl logs hz-hazelcast-0

== Step 3. Create a map

In this step, you'll create a map called `mydistributedmap` with three entries.

. In a new terminal window, start the SQL shell. Replace `<MEMBER_IP>` with the IP address of one of your Hazelcast members.
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run --network hazelcast-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{ee-version} hz-cli --targets hello-world@<MEMBER_IP> sql
----
. Create the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING mydistributedmap TYPE IMap OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='varchar','valueFormat'='varchar');
----
. Add data to the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
SINK INTO mydistributedmap VALUES
('1', 'John'),
('2', 'Mary'),
('3', 'Jane');
----
. Exit the SQL shell using the `exit` command.

== Step 4. Monitor the map

Now, check the map in Management Center.

. Open a new terminal and start Management Center.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:{page-latest-supported-mc}
----
. In a web browser, go to localhost:8080 and enable Dev Mode.
+
image:mc-dev-mode.png[Enabling Dev mode in Management Center]
. You will see a **Connect** box on the screen; click on it and enter your cluster's name (`hello-world`) and IP addresses/ports of three members.
// need explicit guidance on how to do this - example shows same IP but different ports yet instructions are separate IP and ports
+
image:connect-cluster.png[Connecting Management Center to the cluster]
. Once you click on the **Connect** button, you should see that the cluster is in an active state and has three members.
+
image:cluster-connected.png[Management Center is now connected to the cluster]
. Click on **View Cluster** and go to **Storage > Maps**. You can confirm that the map you've created in Step 3 has data with three entries.
+
image:cluster-maps.png[Map listing]
. As an optional step, if you want to see the details of `mydistributedmap`, click on it on the screen shown above and check the "Map Statistics" box.
+
image:map-details.png[Map details]

== Step 5. Shut down the cluster

Now, you'll shut down the whole cluster using Management Center.

. While in Management Center, go to **Cluster** > **Administration**, and select the **Cluster State** tab. 
+
image:cluster-state.png[Shutting down the cluster]
. Click on the **Shutdown** button and confirm it on the dialog shown afterwards.

Management Center now shows that it is disconnected from the cluster. You can also confirm
this by checking the terminals where you started the members; they are now exited to the shell, meaning all the members are gone.

// 2025-07-18 15:21:50,538 [ INFO] [hz.eloquent_cannon..clusterShutdown] [c.h.i.i.Node]: [host.docker.internal]:5702 [hello-world] [5.5.6] Hazelcast Shutdown is completed in 124 ms.

== Step 6. Restart the Cluster

Restart the cluster by starting all the members; run the commands in Step 1 and Step 2 above.

== Step 7. Check the map data

Once all the members are started, go to Management Center, and you can see that it reconnects to the cluster.
Check your map as instructed in Step 4 above; you will see the map and its data has been recovered.
If the persistence was not enabled, the data would be lost in case of a cluster shutdown. 

== Step 8. Shut down the cluster

Shut down the cluster you've created in this tutorial so that you can start a fresh one when you
move to the other tutorials. To shutdown, close the terminals in which the members are running or press kbd:[Ctrl+C] in each terminal.
You may also consider to delete the `persist` directory you've created while starting the members in Step 1 and 2.

// rm -rf ~/persist*
