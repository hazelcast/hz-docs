= Static Configuration
:description: You can configure {ucn} using static configuration in an XML or YAML file, or programmatically. The configuration is applied on start-up. 
:page-enterprise: true
:page-beta: false

{description}

To statically configure {ucn} for your user code, you must do the following:

* If not already done, xref:clusters:ucn-enable.adoc[]
* Define the name of the {ucn}
* Define the locations of the resources
* Identify the namespace used by the required user code in the data structure

You can also configure a `default` namespace, which can be used to provide resources when no specific {ucn} have been configured. For example, a data structure without an associated namespace, a partition loss listener, or when you are using an API that is not namespace-aware. For further information on using the `default` namespace, see the xref:clusters:ucn-non-associated.adoc[] topic.

If you want to instantiate and register a customization that looks up code in a namespace, you must also configure the permissions. For further information on permissions, see the xref:clusters:ucn-security.adoc[] and xref:security:client-authorization.adoc[] topics.

== In the Hazelcast Configuration File

To use the _hazelcast_ configuration file to configure {ucn}, see the following topics:

* xref:clusters:ucn-member-side.adoc[]. This explains how to define the name of the {ucn} and the location of the related resources
* xref:clusters:ucn-data-structures.adoc[]. This explains how to define the {ucn} used by your data structures

== Programmatically

To configure {ucn} programmatically, see the xref:clusters:ucn-static-programmatic.adoc[] topic.
