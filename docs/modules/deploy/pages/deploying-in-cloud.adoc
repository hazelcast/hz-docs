:description: Deploy a Hazelcast cluster in cloud environments including Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud}, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure.

{description}

All these environments support the following features:

- Allow members to discover each other automatically without static IP configuration.
- Prevent data loss by creating partition backups in other Availability Zones (AZ).

== Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud}

Deploy a Hazelcast application on xref:cloud:ROOT:overview.adoc[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud}].

== Hazelcast AWS

Deploy a Hazelcast application on https://aws.amazon.com/[Amazon Web Services].

To deploy a cluster on Amazon EC2, ECS/EC2, or ECS/Fargate, see xref:deploy:deploying-on-aws.adoc[].

To deploy a cluster on Amazon EKS/Fargate or EKS/EC2, see xref:kubernetes:deploying-in-kubernetes.adoc[].
