:page-aliases: installing-using-download-archives.adoc, deploy:running-in-modular-java.adoc

{description}

NOTE: These instructions apply only to the {open-source-product-name}. If you have a license, which allows you to take advantage of the additional features offered by {enterprise-product-name}, follow the instructions in the xref:install-enterprise.adoc[] topic.

We recommend that you learn more about the benefits of an {enterprise-product-name} license to ensure that you do not require any of the additional functionality or support before you install {open-source-product-name}. If you continue with the {open-source-product-name} installation, you can move your {open-source-product-name} members to {enterprise-product-name} at any time if you subsequently want to benefit from the {enterprise-product-name} functionality without downtime. 

For further information on the available {enterprise-product-name} features and on moving members from an {open-source-product-name} cluster to a target {enterprise-product-name} cluster, see xref:migrate:community-to-enterprise.adoc[].

== Distributions

Both slim and full distributions are available. For further information on the available editions and distributions, see the xref:editions.adoc[] topic.

You must use one of the following installation methods if you want to install the slim distribution:

* <<Using Docker>>
* <<Using the Binary>>
* <<Using Java>>

To install a slim distribution, append `-slim` to the version number in the commands shown in the following sections; for example, to install the slim distribution of {os-version}, use `{os-version}-slim`.

== Using a Package Manager

Hazelcast offers package managers for Linux and Mac operating systems.

Package managers are the fastest way of installing Hazelcast. This option is for development purposes and is only available for Hazelcast {open-source-product-name}. For production, use the other deployment options explained on this page.

// tag::cli[]
. To install Hazelcast, use one of the following methods, depending on your operating system:

// end::binary[]

To start the cluster, see xref:get-started-binary.adoc[].

== Using Java

// tag::java[]
To install Hazelcast with Java, you can use one of the following:

- Maven
- JAR file
- Modular Java
// end::java[]

=== Using Maven

// tag::maven[]
Hazelcast runs on Java, which means you can add it as a dependency in your Java project.

The Java package includes both a member API and a Java client API. The member API is for xref:deploy:choosing-a-deployment-option.adoc[embedded topologies] where you want to deploy and manage a cluster in the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as your applications. The Java client is for connecting to an existing member in a client/server topology, such as xref:cloud:ROOT:overview.adoc[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud}].

. Download and install a xref:deploy:supported-jvms.adoc#supported-java-virtual-machines[supported JDK].

. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file.
// end::maven[]
+
--
// tag::maven-full[]

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
       <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
       <version>{os-version}</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

// end::maven-full[]
--

. xref:get-started-java.adoc[Start the cluster].

=== Using the JAR

If you aren't using a build tool:

ifdef::snapshot[]
* link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/hazelcast/{os-version}/hazelcast-{os-version}.jar[download the Hazelcast JAR file]
endif::[]
ifndef::snapshot[]
* link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/hazelcast/{full-version}/hazelcast-{full-version}.jar[download the Hazelcast JAR file]
endif::[]
* add it to your classpath.

=== Using Modular Java

// tag::modular[]
You can use Hazelcast as a module in the http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/[Java Platform Module System] (JPMS).

To run your application with Hazelcast
libraries on the modulepath, use the `com.hazelcast.core` for `hazelcast-{os-version}.jar` module name.

The JPMS comes with stricter visibility rules. It affects
Hazelcast which uses the internal Java API to reach the best performance results.

Hazelcast needs the `java.se` module and access to the following Java
packages:

* `java.base/jdk.internal.ref`
* `java.base/java.nio` _(reflective access)_
* `java.base/sun.nio.ch` _(reflective access)_
* `java.base/java.lang` _(reflective access)_
* `jdk.management/com.ibm.lang.management.internal` _(reflective access)_
* `jdk.management/com.sun.management.internal` _(reflective access)_
* `java.management/sun.management` _(reflective access)_

You can provide access to these packages by using
`--add-exports` and `--add-opens` (for reflective access) Java arguments.

  --add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.ref=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.management/sun.management=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens jdk.management/com.ibm.lang.management.internal=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens jdk.management/com.sun.management.internal=ALL-UNNAMED \
  -jar hazelcast-{os-version}.jar
----

.Running a Member on the Modulepath
[source,bash]
----
java --add-modules java.se \
  --add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.ref=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens java.base/java.lang=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens java.base/java.nio=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens java.management/sun.management=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens jdk.management/com.ibm.lang.management.internal=com.hazelcast.core \
  --add-opens jdk.management/com.sun.management.internal=com.hazelcast.core \
  --module-path lib \ <1>
  --module com.hazelcast.core/com.hazelcast.core.server.HazelcastMemberStarter
----
<1> This example expects the `hazelcast-{os-version}.jar` file in the `lib` directory.

// end::modular[]
