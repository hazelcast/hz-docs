= List of Hazelcast Metrics
[[appendix]]

The table below lists the metrics with their explanations in grouped by their relevant subjects.

The metrics are collected per member and specific to the local member from which
you collect them. For example, the distributed data structure metrics
reflect the local statistics of that data structure for the portion
held in that member.

Some metrics may store cluster-wide agreed value, that is, they may show the values obtained
by communicating with other members in the cluster. This type of
metrics reflect the member's local view of the cluster (consider split-brain scenarios). The `clusterStartTime` is an example of this type of
metrics, and its value in the local member is obtained by communicating
with the master member.

.Streaming Engine Cluster-Wide Metrics
[%collapsible]
====
[cols="h,a,a"]
|===
|Name|Description|Tags

|blockingWorkerCount
|Number of non-cooperative workers employed.
.6+|_none_

Each Hazelcast member will have one instance of this metric.

|jobs.submitted
|Number of computational jobs submitted.

|jobs.completedSuccessfully
|Number of computational jobs successfully completed.

|jobs.completedWithFailure
|Number of computational jobs that have failed.

|jobs.executionStarted
|Number of computational job executions started. Each job can
execute multiple times, for example when it’s restarted or
suspended and then resumed.

|jobs.executionTerminated
|Number of computational job executions finished. Each job can
execute multiple times, for example when it’s restarted or
suspended and then resumed.

|iterationCount
|The total number of iterations the driver of tasklets in
cooperative thread N made. It should increase by at least 250
iterations/s. Lower value means some of the cooperative
processors blocks for too long. Somewhat lower value is normal
if there are many tasklets assigned to the processor. Lower
value affects the latency.
.2+|_cooperativeWorker_

Each Hazelcast member will have one of this metric for each of its
cooperative worker threads.

|taskletCount
|The number of assigned tasklets to cooperative thread N.

.Streaming Engine Job-specific Metrics
[%collapsible]
====
All job specific metrics have their `job=<jobId>` and
`exec=<executionId>` tags set and most also have the
`vertex=<vertexName>` tag set (with very few exceptions). This means
that most of these metrics will have at least one instance for each
vertex of each current job execution.

Additionally, if the vertex sourcing them is a data source or data sink,
then the `source` or `sink` tags will also be set to true.

[cols="h,a,a"]
|===
|Name|Description|Tags

|executionStartTime
|Start time of the current execution of the job (epoch time in milliseconds).
.4+|_job, exec_


There will be a single instance of these metrics for each job
execution.

|executionCompletionTime
|Completion time of the current execution of the job (epoch time
in milliseconds).

|status
|Information regarding the job's status. Potential values:
0 - submitted;
1 - initialization phase;
2 - running;
3 - suspended;
4 - exporting snapshot;
5 - completing phase;
6 - failed;
7 - completed successfully;

|userCancelled

.2+|_job, exec, vertex_

There will be a single instance of these metrics for each
vertex.

|snapshotKeys
|Total number of keys written out in the last snapshot.

|distributedBytesIn
|Total number of bytes received from remote members.
.4+|_job, exec, vertex, ordinal_

Each Hazelcast member will have an instance of these metrics for each
ordinal of each vertex of each job execution.

Note: These metrics are only present for distributed edges, i.e., 
edges producing network traffic.

|distributedBytesOut
|Total number of bytes sent to remote members.

|distributedItemsIn
|Total number of items received from remote members.

|distributedItemsOut
|Total number of items sent to remote members.

|topObservedWm
|This value is equal to the highest coalescedWm on any input edge
of this processor.
.6+|_job, exec, vertex, proc_

Each Hazelcast member will have one instances of these metrics for
each processor instance N, the N denotes the global processor
index. Processor is the parallel worker doing the work of the
vertex.

|coalescedWm
|The highest watermark received from all inputs that was sent to
the processor to handle.

|lastForwardedWm
|Last watermark emitted by the processor to output.

|lastForwardedWmLatency
|The difference between <i>lastForwardedWn</i> and the system
time at the moment when metrics were collected.

|The total number of items waiting in input queues.

|topObservedWm
|The highest received watermark from any input on edge N.
.5+|_job, exec, vertex, proc, ordinal_

Each Hazelcast member will have one instance of these metrics for each
edge M (input or output) of each processor N. N is the global
processor index and M is either the ordinal of the edge or has
the value snapshot for output items written to state snapshot.

|coalescedWm
|The highest watermark received from all upstream processors on
edge N.

|emittedCount
|The number of emitted items. This number includes watermarks,
snapshot barriers etc. Unlike _distributedItemsOut_, it
includes items emitted items to local processors.

|receivedCount
|The number of received items. This number does not include
watermarks, snapshot barriers etc. It’s the number of items the
Processor.process method will receive.

|receivedBatches
|The number of received batches. `Processor.process`
receives a batch of items at a time, this is the number of such
batches. By dividing _receivedCount_ by
_receivedBatches_, you get the average batch size. It will
be 1 under low load.

|numInFlightOps
|The number of pending (in flight) operations when using
asynchronous mapping processors. See https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/processor/Processors.html#mapUsingServiceAsyncP-com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.ServiceFactory-int-boolean-com.hazelcast.function.FunctionEx-com.hazelcast.function.BiFunctionEx-[Processors.mapUsingServiceAsyncP].
.6+|_job, exec, vertex, proc, procType_

Processor specific metrics, only certain types of processors
have them. The _procType_ tag can be used to identify the
exact type of processor sourcing them. Like all processor
metrics, each Hazelcast member will have one instances of these
metrics for each processor instance N, the N denotes the global
processor index.

3+a|
The above `*latency` metrics are only measured for the members and they are not representing the overall performance of the cluster.
We recommend monitoring the average latency for each operation, for example, `map.totalGetLatency` / `map.getCount` and `map.totalSetLatency` / `map.setCount`.
Increased average latency is a sign that the cluster would experience performance problems, or there is a spike in the load.
The following may be the reasons:

* Increase in the load on the cluster: If the cluster is under heavy load, this can lead to increased latency for all operations, slowing down the overall performance.
* Increasing member count in the cluster: As the number of cluster members increases, the total latency for operations can also increase.
This is because the cluster has to communicate with more members, which can add to the overall latency. This might be a data architecture problem.
* Increasing the data set size: This causes the cluster to search through more data to find the requested data, which can slow down the overall performance. Creating indexes may solve these kind of problems.
* Increasing the number of concurrent operations: This causes the cluster to process more requests at the same time, which can slow down the overall performance. This is a potential bottleneck on resources (CPU, memory, network).

|`map.index.averageHitLatency`

|`map.index.averageHitSelectivity`
|percent
|Average selectivity of the hits served by the index on this member (the returned value is in the range from 0.0 to 1.0 - values close to 1.0 indicate a high selectivity meaning the index is efficient; values close to 0.0 indicate a low selectivity meaning the index efficiency is approaching an efficiency of a simple full scan)

|`map.index.creationTime`
|ms
|Creation time of the index on this member

|`map.index.hitCount`
|count
|Total number of index hits (the value of this metric may be greater than the `map.index.queryCount` since a single query may hit the same index more than once)
