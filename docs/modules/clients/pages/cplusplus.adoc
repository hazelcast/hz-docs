== Overview

This section provides information about the {cpp} client for Hazelcast, and explains how to install and use the client.

TIP: To learn how to get started quickly with the Hazelcast {cpp} client, follow our simple xref:clients:cpp-client-getting-started.adoc[Get started with {cpp}] tutorial.

The Hazelcast native {cpp} client is an official library that allows {cpp} applications to connect to and interact with Hazelcast clusters. With the Hazelcast {cpp} client, developers can build high-performance, distributed applications in {cpp} that leverage Hazelcast's powerful in-memory computing platform.
The key features and benefits include:

* Distributed Data Structures: the client offers access to various distributed data structures such as Map, Queue, Reliable Topic, Set, List, MultiMap, RingBuffer, etc. 
* Near Cache Support: the Near Cache feature allows frequently read data to be stored for faster read speeds compared to traditional caches.
* Enterprise-Level security: the client provides SSL support for enhanced security requirements.
* Distributed synchronization: the client offers distributed synchronization mechanisms through the CP Subsystem, including fenced_lock, counting_semaphore and latch.
* Smart Client functionality: by default, it operates as a smart client, meaning it knows the data location within the cluster and can directly request the correct member (note that you can disable this feature using the `client_config::get_networking_config::set_smart_routing` method if you do not want the clients to connect to every member).
* Listeners: ability to add cluster listeners to a cluster and entry/item listeners to distributed data structures.
* Cloud integration: it offers the ability to discover existing Hazelcast clusters in an AWS environment.
* Asynchronous operations: the client supports asynchronous execution of tasks in the cluster and non-blocking asynchronous methods for improved performance.
* Flexible installation: it can be installed using package managers like Vcpkg or Conan, or built from source using CMake.

The {cpp} client API is fully asynchronous. The API returns `boost::future` API which has the capability of 
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/doc/html/thread/synchronization.html#thread.synchronization.futures.then[continuations]. To make sure the requested operation is completed in the cluster and committed in the distributed database, you must wait for the result of the future. 

TIP: For the latest {cpp} API documentation, see http://hazelcast.github.io/hazelcast-cpp-client/{page-latest-supported-cplusplus-client}/index.html[Hazelcast {cpp} Client docs].

The {cpp} client uses Hazelcast's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-client-protocol[Open Client Protocol]. 
This is the client-server protocol that Hazelcast uses to communicate with the clients. 

== Install the {cpp} client

This section explains how to install the Hazelcast {cpp} client.

=== Vcpkg users
Hazelcast {cpp} client package is available for https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg[Vcpkg] users. The package name is `hazelcast-cpp-client`.

See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#getting-started[Get started with vcpkg] to learn how to use the Vcpkg package manager with your application. In summary:

If you use Linux or Mac:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg --branch 2025.02.14
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
./vcpkg/vcpkg install "hazelcast-cpp-client[openssl]" --recurse
``` 

If you use Windows:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg --branch 2025.02.14
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg\vcpkg install "hazelcast-cpp-client[openssl]:x64-windows" --recurse
``` 
The above code snippet installs `hazelcast-cpp-client` with its `boost` and `openssl` dependencies.

After installation, the library is available to use. For example, if you are using CMake for your builds, you can use the following cmake build command with the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` cmake option to be the `vcpkg.cmake`.
```bat
cmake -B [build directory] -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build [build directory]
```

=== Conan users
The Hazelcast {cpp} client package is indexed at https://conan.io/center/hazelcast-cpp-client[Conan Center Index]. You can use the https://conan.io/[Conan package manager] to install Hazelcast {cpp} client. The package name is `hazelcast-cpp-client`.

See https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#an-md5-hash-calculator-using-the-poco-libraries[example instructions] on how to use the Conan package manager with your application. In summary:

Put the following lines into your `conanfile.txt`:
```
[requires]
hazelcast-cpp-client/5.2.0

[generators]
cmake
```
Then, execute the following:
```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ conan install ..
```
This generates the `conanbuildinfo.cmake` file to be included in your CMakeLists.txt. Follow the instructions at the https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#an-md5-hash-calculator-using-the-poco-libraries[example page] and build your application.

=== Install from source code using CMake
==== Requirements
1. Linux, macOS or Windows
2. A compiler that supports {cpp}11
3. https://cmake.org[CMake] 3.10 or above
4. https://www.boost.org[Boost] 1.71 or above. Minimum boost version is upgraded to 1.73 for Windows due to https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/issues/431[this] bug
5. https://www.openssl.org[OpenSSL] (optional)

==== Download source code
Go to the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/releases[releases] page to download the source code for the latest Hazelcast {cpp} client.

The releases page has both `tar.gz` and `zip` archives available. Choose the one that best suits your system.

Follow the instructions for your platform:

==== Linux and macOS users
To download and extract version 5.2.0 using the **curl** command:
```sh
curl -Lo hazelcast-cpp-client-5.2.0.tar.gz https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/archive/v5.2.0.tar.gz
tar xzf hazelcast-cpp-client-5.2.0.tar.gz
```

Alternatively, clone the repository and checkout a specific version:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client.git
cd hazelcast-cpp-client
git checkout v5.2.0
```

Once you are in the source directory of the Hazelcast {cpp} client library, create and change into a new directory:
```sh
cd hazelcast-cpp-client-5.2.0
mkdir build
cd build
```

Run `cmake` (or `cmake3` if you are on CentOS or RHEL) to configure:
```sh
cmake ..
```
See the xref:clients:cplusplus.adoc#advanced-installation[Advanced installation] section below for configuration options.

Run `cmake` again to build and install the library:
```sh
cmake --build . 
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```

You can speed up the build process with parallel threads like 'cmake --build . -j 4'

For information on how to use a different installation location, see xref:clients:cplusplus.adoc#custom-install-location[Custom install location].

==== Windows users
Download and extract the release archive from the 
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/releases[releases] page.

Open a `cmd` window and switch to the folder where you extracted the contents of the release archive. Then create and change to a new directory:
```bat
cd hazelcast-cpp-client-5.2.0
mkdir build
cd build
```

Run `cmake` to configure:
```bat
cmake ..
``` 
See the xref:clients:cplusplus.adoc#advanced-installation[advanced installation] section for configuration options.

Build and install:
```bat
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --build . --target install --config Release
```
The above commands will build and install the library with the `Release` configuration. Make sure you pass the same `--config` option to both commands.

The install command may require administrator privileges depending on your install prefix. See xref:clients:cplusplus.adoc#custom-install-location[Custom install location] for information on how to use a different installation location.

==== Advanced installation

===== Custom install location
The first time you run `cmake`, pass the argument `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install` to configure the installation directory:
```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
```

===== CMake configuration
You can provide additional configuration options using the `-DVARIABLE=VALUE` syntax on the command line. Below are all the supported options:

- `WITH_OPENSSL` : Set to `ON` to build the library with SSL support.
This will require https://www.openssl.org[OpenSSL] to be installed on your system. The default is `OFF`.
- `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` : Set to `ON` or `OFF` depending on whether you want the shared(ON) or static(OFF) library. The default is `ON`.
- `DISABLE_LOGGING` : Setting this option to `ON` disables logging. The default is `OFF`.

For example, if you want to build the static library with SSL support, use the following command:

```sh
cmake .. -DWITH_OPENSSL=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
```

NOTE: If you want to use the `hazelcast-cpp-client` library with the `-DWITH_OPENSSL=ON` option without `find_package()` you must define the `HZ_BUILD_WITH_SSL` symbolic constant before including any `hazelcast-cpp-client` header. This symbolic constant can be defined via compiler options or can be passed directly through the cmake command as `-DVARIABLE=VALUE` pairs.

For example:
```sh
g++ -DHZ_BUILD_WITH_SSL -DBOOST_CHRONO_DYN_LINK -DBOOST_CHRONO_NO_LIB -DBOOST_THREAD_DYN_LINK -DBOOST_THREAD_NO_LIB -DBOOST_THREAD_VERSION=5 -I/var/git/hazelcast-cpp-client/build/include -std=gnu++11 -c main.cpp
```

== Start a Hazelcast cluster

The Hazelcast {cpp} client requires a working Hazelcast cluster to run. This cluster handles storage and manipulation of the user data. Clients are a way to connect to the Hazelcast cluster and access such data.

A Hazelcast cluster consists of one or more cluster members. These members generally run on multiple virtual or physical machines and are connected to each other via the network. Any data put on the cluster is partitioned to multiple members in a way that is transparent to the user. It is therefore easy to scale the system by adding new members as the data grows. Hazelcast clusters also offer resilience. Should any hardware or software problem causes a crash to any member, the data on that member is recovered from backups and the cluster continues to operate without any downtime. Using a Hazelcast client is an easy way to connect to a Hazelcast cluster and perform tasks on distributed data structures that reside on the cluster.

To use the Hazelcast {cpp} client, we first need to setup a Hazelcast server.

=== Start a Hazelcast server

==== Use a Hazelcast Docker images

The quickest way to start a single member cluster for development purposes is to use our https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast/[Docker images].

```bash
docker run -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:latest
```

==== Use Hazelcast distribution

Alternatively, follow the instructions below to create a Hazelcast cluster:

1. Go to Hazelcast's download https://hazelcast.com/open-source-projects/downloads/[page] and download either the `.zip` or `.tar` distribution of Hazelcast.
2. Decompress the contents into any directory that you want to run members from.
3. Change into the directory that you decompressed the Hazelcast content and then into the `bin` directory.
4. Use either `hz start` or `hz-start.bat` depending on your operating system. Once you run the start script, you should see the Hazelcast logs in the terminal.

You should see a log similar to the following, which means that your single member cluster is ready to be used:

```
Nov 19, 2022 2:52:59 PM com.hazelcast.internal.cluster.ClusterService
INFO: [192.168.1.112]:5701 [dev] [<i>5.x.x</i>]

Members {size:1, ver:1} [
        Member [192.168.1.112]:5701 - 360ba49b-ef33-4590-9abd-ceff3e31dc06 this
]

Nov 19, 2022 2:52:59 PM com.hazelcast.core.LifecycleService
INFO: [192.168.1.112]:5701 [dev] [<i>5.x.x</i>] [192.168.1.112]:5701 is STARTED
```

==== Add user Java library to Java CLASSPATH

When you want to use features such as querying and language interoperability, you may need to add your own Java classes to the Hazelcast member in order to use them from your C++ client. This can be done by adding your own compiled code to the `CLASSPATH`. To do this, compile your code with the `CLASSPATH` and add the compiled files to the `user-lib` directory in the extracted `hazelcast-<version>.zip` (or `tar`). Then, you can start your Hazelcast member by using the start scripts in the `bin` directory. The start scripts will automatically add your compiled classes to the `CLASSPATH`.

NOTE: If you are adding an `IdentifiedDataSerializable` or a `Portable` class, you need to add its factory too. Then, you configure the factory in the `hazelcast.xml` configuration file. This file resides in the `bin` directory where you extracted the `hazelcast-<version>.zip` (or `tar`).

The following is an example configuration when adding an `IdentifiedDataSerializable` class:

```xml
<hazelcast>
     ...
     <serialization>
        <data-serializable-factories>
            <data-serializable-factory factory-id="66">
                com.hazelcast.client.test.IdentifiedFactory
            </data-serializable-factory>
        </data-serializable-factories>
    </serialization>
    ...
</hazelcast>
```
To add a `Portable` class, use `<portable-factories>` instead of `<data-serializable-factories>` in the above configuration.

See the https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/configuration/understanding-configuration[Hazelcast documentation] for more information on setting up the clusters.

=== Compile your project

If you are using CMake, see the section below for CMake users, otherwise follow the instructions specific to your platform:

==== CMake users
The Hazelcast C++ client installation comes with package configuration files for CMake. If your project is using CMake, you can easily find and link against the client library:
```cmake
find_package(hazelcast-cpp-client CONFIG REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(mytarget PRIVATE hazelcast-cpp-client::hazelcast-cpp-client)
```

Make sure you add the installation prefix of the client library to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` if you are using a custom installation location. 

==== Linux and MacOS users
You can pass the `-lhazelcast-cpp-client` option to the compiler to link against the client library. 

The client library depends on Boost.Thread and Boost.Chrono. You should also link your program against these libraries using `-lboost_thread` and `-lboost_chrono`. The Boost.Thread library should be provided with the preprocessor definition `BOOST_THREAD_VERSION=5` for necessary features such as futures and future continuations to be enabled. 

The following shows how to compile an example from the examples directory:
```sh
g++ -std=c++11 \
    examples/path/to/example.cpp \
    -DBOOST_THREAD_VERSION=5 \
    -lhazelcast-cpp-client -lboost_thread -lboost_chrono -lssl -lcrypto
``` 

If your environment could not find openssl library, define it as below (As an example: `-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1t/lib`)

```
g++ -std=c++11 \
    examples/path/to/example.cpp \
    -DBOOST_THREAD_VERSION=5 \
    -lhazelcast-cpp-client -lboost_thread -lboost_chrono -lssl -lcrypto
    -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1t/lib
```

If a custom installation directory was used during installation, you may also need to use the `-L` and `-I` options to add the library and include paths to the compiler's search path.
```
g++ -std=c++11 \
    examples/path/to/example.cpp \
    -I /path/to/install/include -L /path/to/install/lib \
    -lhazelcast-cpp-client -lboost_thread -lboost_chrono  -lssl -lcrypto
```

==== Windows users
Provide your compiler with the include directories and library files for the Hazelcast {cpp} client and its dependencies.

You also need to pass the preprocessor definition `BOOST_THREAD_VERSION=5` for necessary features such as futures and future continuations to be enabled. 

You can use the following command to compile an example from the examples directory:
```bat
cl.exe path\to\example.cpp ^
    C:\path\to\hazelcast\lib\hazelcast-cpp-client.lib ^
    C:\path\to\boost\lib\boost_thread.lib C:\path\to\boost\lib\boost_chrono.lib ^
    /EHsc /DBOOST_THREAD_VERSION=5 ^
    /I C:\path\to\hazelcast\include /I C:\path\to\boost\include
```

== Basic configuration

If you are using Hazelcast and the Hazelcast {cpp} Client on the same computer, the default configuration is generally fine, and ideal for trying out the client. However, if you run the client on a different computer than any of the cluster members, you may need to do some simple configuration such as specifying the member addresses.

Hazelcast members and clients have their own configuration options. You may need to reflect some of the member-side configurations on the client side to connect properly to the cluster.

This section describes the most common configuration elements to get you started quickly. It outlines some member-side configuration options to help you understand Hazelcast's ecosystem, together with client-side configuration options for cluster connection. The configurations for the Hazelcast data structures that can be used in the {cpp} client are also explained in the following sections.

For more detailed information, see the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/Reference_Manual.md#3-configuration-overview[Configuration Overview]. 

=== Configuring Hazelcast server

Hazelcast aims to run 'out of the box' for most common scenarios. However, if you have limitations on your network such as multicast being disabled, you may have to configure your Hazelcast members so that they can find each other on the network. Also, since most of the distributed data structures are configurable, you may want to tailor them according to your needs. This section shows you the basics of network configuration.

Use one of the following options to configure Hazelcast:

- The `hazelcast.xml` configuration file.
- Programmatically configure the member before starting it from the Java code.

Since we use standalone servers, we will use the `hazelcast.xml` file to configure our cluster members.

When you download and unzip `hazelcast-<version>.zip` (or `tar`), the `hazelcast.xml` appears in the `bin` directory. When a Hazelcast member starts, it looks for the `hazelcast.xml` file to load the configuration from. A sample `hazelcast.xml` is shown below.

```xml
<hazelcast>
    <cluster-name>dev</cluster-name>

    <network>
        <port auto-increment="true" port-count="100">5701</port>
        <join>
            <multicast enabled="true">
                <multicast-group>224.2.2.3</multicast-group>
                <multicast-port>54327</multicast-port>
            </multicast>
            <tcp-ip enabled="false">
                <interface>127.0.0.1</interface>
                <member-list>
                    <member>127.0.0.1</member>
                </member-list>
            </tcp-ip>
        </join>
        <ssl enabled="false"/>
    </network>
    <partition-group enabled="false"/>
    <map name="default">
        <backup-count>1</backup-count>
    </map>
</hazelcast>
```

Other important configuration elements include:

* `<cluster-name>`: Specifies which cluster this member belongs to. 
* `<network>`
    ** `<port>`: Specifies the port number to be used by the member when it starts. Its default value is 5701. You can specify another port number, and if you set `auto-increment` to `true`, then Hazelcast will try the subsequent ports until it finds an available port or the `port-count` is reached.
    ** `<join>`: Specifies the strategies to be used by the member to find other cluster members. Choose which strategy you want to
    use by setting its `enabled` attribute to `true` and the others to `false`.
        *** `<multicast>`: Members find each other by sending multicast requests to the specified address and port. It is useful if IP addresses of the members are not static.
        *** `<tcp>`: This strategy uses a pre-configured list of known members to find an already existing cluster. It is enough for a member to find only one cluster member to connect to the cluster. The rest of the member list is automatically retrieved from that member. We recommend putting multiple known member addresses there to avoid disconnectivity should one of the members in the list is unavailable at the time of connection.

These configuration elements are enough for most connection scenarios. Next, we will look at the configuration of the {cpp} client.

=== Configuring Hazelcast C++ client

You must configure the Hazelcast {cpp} client programmatically as config files of any type are not yet supported.

You can start the client with no custom configuration like this:

```c++
    auto hz = hazelcast::new_client().get(); // Connects to the cluster
```

This section describes some network configuration settings to cover common use cases in connecting the client to a cluster. See the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/Reference_Manual.md#3-configuration-overview[Configuration Overview] and the following sections for information about detailed network configurations and/or additional features of Hazelcast {cpp} client configuration.

An easy way to configure your Hazelcast {cpp} client is to create a `client_config` object and set the appropriate options. Then you need to pass this object to the client when starting it, as shown below:

```c++
    hazelcast::client::client_config config;
    config.set_cluster_name("my-cluster"); // the server is configured to use the `my_cluster` as the cluster name hence we need to match it to be able to connect to the server.
    config.get_network_config().add_address(address("192.168.1.10", 5701));
    auto hz = hazelcast::new_client(std::move(config)).get(); // Connects to the cluster member at ip address `192.168.1.10` and port 5701
```

If you run Hazelcast members in a different server than the client, you most probably have configured the ports and the cluster names of the members as explained in the previous section. If you did, you need to make certain changes to the network settings of your client.

=== Cluster name

You only need to provide the name of the cluster if it is explicitly configured on the server side (otherwise the default value of `dev` is used).

```c++
hazelcast::client::client_config config;
config.set_cluster_name("my-cluster"); // the server is configured to use the `my_cluster` as the cluster name hence we need to match it to be able to connect to the server.
```

=== Network settings

You need to provide the IP address and port of at least one member in your cluster so the client can find it.

```c++
hazelcast::client::client_config config;
config.get_network_config().add_address(hazelcast::client::address("your server ip", 5701 /* your server port*/));
```
=== Client system properties

While configuring your {cpp} client, you can use various system properties provided by Hazelcast to tune its clients. These properties can be set programmatically through `config.set_property` or by using an environment variable. The value of this property will be:

- the programmatically configured value, if programmatically set
- the environment variable value, if the environment variable is set
- the default value, if none of the above is set.

See the following for an example client system property configuration:

**Programmatically:**

```c++
config.set_property(hazelcast::client::client_properties::INVOCATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, "2") // Sets invocation timeout as 2 seconds
```

or 

```c++
config.set_property("hazelcast.client.invocation.timeout.seconds", "2") // Sets invocation timeout as 2 seconds
```

**By using an environment variable on Linux:** 

```sh
export hazelcast.client.invocation.timeout.seconds=2
```

If you set a property both programmatically and via an environment variable, the programmatically set value will be used. 

See the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/hazelcast/include/hazelcast/client/client_properties.h[complete list of system properties], along with their descriptions, which can be used to configure your Hazelcast {cpp} client.

== Basic usage

Now that we have a working cluster and we know how to configure both our cluster and client, we can run a simple program to use a distributed map with the {cpp} client.

The following example first creates a programmatic configuration object. Then, it starts a client.

```c++
#include <hazelcast/client/hazelcast_client.h>
int main() {
    auto hz = hazelcast::new_client().get(); // Connects to the cluster
    std::cout << "Started the Hazelcast C++ client instance " << hz.get_name() << std::endl; // Prints client instance name
    hz.shutdown().get();
    return 0;
}
```
This prints logs about the cluster members and information about the client itself, such as client type and local address port.

Congratulations! You just started a Hazelcast {cpp} client.

**Using a Map**

Next, manipulate a distributed map on a cluster using the client.

Save the following file as `IT.cpp` and compile it using a command similar to the following (Linux g++ compilation is used for demonstration):

```c++
g++ IT.cpp -o IT -lhazelcast-cpp-client -lboost_thread -lboost_chrono -DBOOST_THREAD_VERSION=5 -lssl -lcrypto --std=c++11
```
Then, you can run the application using the following command:
 
```
./IT
```

**IT.cpp**

```c++
#include <hazelcast/client/hazelcast_client.h>
int main() {
    auto hz = hazelcast::new_client().get(); // Connects to the cluster

    auto personnel = hz.get_map("personnel_map").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Amanda", "IT").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Rob", "IT").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Olly", "IT").get();
    std::cout << "Added IT personnel. Logging all known personnel" << std::endl;
    for (const auto &entry : personnel->entry_set<std::string, std::string>().get()) {
        std::cout << entry.first << " is in " << entry.second << " department." << std::endl;
    }
    hz.shutdown().get();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```

Added IT personnel. Logging all known personnel
Amanda is in IT department
Olly is in IT department
Rob is in IT department
```

This example puts all the IT personnel into a cluster-wide `personnel_map` and then prints all the known personnel.

Now create a `Sales.cpp` file, compile and run it as shown below:

**Compile:**

```c++
g++ Sales.cpp -o Sales -lhazelcast-cpp-client -lboost_thread -lboost_chrono -DBOOST_THREAD_VERSION=5 -lssl -lcrypto --std=c++11
```
**Run**

Then, run the application using the following command:

```
./Sales
```

**Sales.cpp**

```c++
#include <hazelcast/client/hazelcast_client.h>
int main() {
auto hz = hazelcast::new_client().get(); // Connects to the cluster

auto personnel = hz.get_map("personnel_map").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Denise", "Sales").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Erwing", "Sales").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Fatih", "Sales").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Rob", "IT").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Olly", "IT").get();
    std::cout << "Added all sales personnel. Logging all known personnel" << std::endl;
    for (const auto &entry : personnel.entry_set().get()) {
        std::cout << entry.first << " is in " << entry.second << " department." << std::endl;
    }
hz.shutdown().get();
return 0;
}
```

**Output**

}
Added Sales personnel. Logging all known personnel
Denise is in Sales department
Erwing is in Sales department
Fatih is in Sales department
Rob is in IT department
Olly is in IT department
```

This time, we added only the sales employees but we get the list of all known employees including the ones in IT. That is because our map lives in the cluster and no matter which client we use, we can access the whole map.

=== Use a sample project

There is an example project in the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/tree/master/sample_project[sample project] directory. Run this as follows:

If you use Linux or Mac:

```sh
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build
./build/client
```

If you use Windows:

```bat
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake && ^ 
cmake --build build && ^
.\build\Debug\client
```

The sample code creates a client, and the client automatically connects to the cluster.
It creates a map named `personnel_map` and puts the records inside it.
It then gets all the entries from the cluster and prints them.
```c++
#include <hazelcast/client/hazelcast_client.h>
int main() {
    auto hz = hazelcast::new_client().get(); // Connects to the cluster

    auto personnel = hz.get_map("personnel_map").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Alice", "IT").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Bob", "IT").get();
    personnel->put<std::string, std::string>("Clark", "IT").get();
    std::cout << "Added IT personnel. Logging all known personnel" << std::endl;
    for (const auto &entry : personnel->entry_set<std::string, std::string>().get()) {
        std::cout << entry.first << " is in " << entry.second << " department." << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
