When you deploy Hazelcast clusters on AWS EC2 instances, you can consider to place the
cluster members on the same https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-cluster[Cluster Placement Group]. This helps to reduce the latency among members drastically.
Additionally, you can also consider using private IPs
instead of public ones to increase the throughput when the cluster
members are placed in the same VPC.

For the best performance of your Hazelcast on AWS EC2:

* Select the newest Linux AMIs.
* Select the HVM based instances.
* Select at least a system with 8 vCPUs, e.g., c4.2xlarge. For an overview of all types of
EC2 instances, please check https://www.ec2instances.info[this web page^].
* Consider setting a placement group.
