= Architecture Overview
[[hazelcast-imdg-architecture]]

Hazelcast is a distributed computation and storage platform for
consistently low-latency querying, aggregation and stateful computation
against event streams and traditional data sources.

A cluster of Hazelcast nodes share both the data storage and computational
load which can dynamically scale up and down. When you add new nodes to the
cluster, both data and computations is automatically rebalanced across
the cluster.

The following are the brief descriptions of blocks in the diagram above from bottom to top.

== Discovery and Clustering

In Hazelcast, data is load-balanced in-memory across a cluster.
This cluster is a network of members each of which runs Hazelcast.
They discover each other automatically and form a cluster; the members
communicate with each other via TCP after the cluster is formed. Hazelcast supports
automatic discovery on cloud environments like Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform and Azure;
you can also configure Hazelcast to discover members by TCP/IP or multicast. In addition,
you can make use of the automatic member discovery in the Kubernetes environment.
See the xref:clusters:discovery-mechanisms.adoc[Discovery Mechanisms section].

== Fault Tolerance with Hazelcast

Hazelcast distributes your storage data, computational data, and backups, among all cluster members. This way, if a member is lost,
Hazelcast can restore the data from these backups, providing continuous availability. As the data itself, its backups are distributed and stored also in the memory (RAM).
The distribution happens on the partition level; the primary data and its backups are stored in
the memory partitions. See xref:overview:data-partitioning.adoc[Data Partitioning] and
xref:clusters:partition-group-configuration.adoc[Partition Grouping] for more information on the partitioning.

When a member in your cluster is lost, Hazelcast redistributes the backups on the
remaining members so that every partition has a backup. This makes Hazelcast resilient
to data loss. The number of backups is configurable. Based on the configuration, data
can be kept in multiple replicas of a partition.

== High Availability with Hazelcast

In Hazelcast, cluster members monitor the health of each other. When a cluster
member becomes inaccessible due to for example a network failure, other members
cooperatively diagnose the state; they immediately take over the responsibility
of the failed member. To determine if a member is unreachable or crashed, Hazelcast
provides built-in failure detectors. See xref:clusters:failure-detector-configuration.adoc[here]
for more information.

Besides the in-cluster failover mechanism mentioned above, Hazelcast also provides replication over WAN.
You can have deployments across multiple data centers using the WAN replication mechanism which offers
protection against a data center or wider network failures. See xref:wan:wan.adoc[here] for more information.

== AP/CP

In the context of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem[CAP principle^],
Hazelcast offers AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) and CP (Consistency and
Partition Tolerance) functionalities with different data structure implementations.
Let’s recall what these functionalities mean:

* Availability: All working members in a distributed system return a valid
response to any request, without exceptions.
* Consistency: All the clients connected to the system see the same data at the same time,
no matter which member they connect to; whenever data is written to a member, it is instantly
replicated to all the other members in the system.
* Partition Tolerance: _Partition_ refers to a lost or temporarily delayed connection between
the members; partition tolerance refers to continued work of the cluster despite any number of
communication breakdowns between the members of the cluster.

Hazelcast as an AP system delivers availability and partition tolerance at the expense of
consistency. When a communication breakdown (partition) occurs, all members remain available;
however some members affected by the partition might return an older version of data than others.
When the partition is resolved, the Hazelcast typically synchronizes the members to repair all inconsistencies in the system.

As a CP system, it delivers consistency and partition tolerance at the expense of availability.
When a partition occurs between any members, Hazelcast makes the non-consistent member unavailable
until the partition is resolved.

Data structures exposed under `HazelcastInstance` API are all AP data structures and the ones
accessed via `HazelcastInstance.getCPSubsytem()` provides CP structures and APIs, which are built
on the Raft consensus algorithm. See the xref:consistency-and-replication:consistency.adoc[Consistency and Replication Model section]
and xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP Subsystem section].

== Storage Engine

Storage engine provides caching and data processing on top of Hazelcast’s key/value store IMap.
You can xref:data-structures:working-with-external-data.adoc[load and store] data
from/to external data sources, control the xref:data-structures:managing-map-memory.adoc[eviction]
of data entries and xref:computing:entry-processor.adoc[execute] your codes on them, use Hazelcast's
specification-compliant xref:jcache:jcache.adoc[JCache] implementation and integrate your cache with Spring.

== Jet (Streaming) Engine

Jet engine runs the streaming applications. For this, it uses many different connectors (sources and sinks)
to get and output data, and stateless/stateful transforms with operators including join, aggregate and sort
to process data: the usage of connectors and operators constitute a data pipeline.

A data pipeline is a series of processing steps that consist of a source, one or more processing steps,
and a sink (destination). It may enable the flow of data from an application to a data warehouse, from
a data lake to an analytics database, or into a payment processing system. Hazelcast allows you to create
data pipelines, using either SQL or the Hazelcast Java API. See the xref:pipelines:overview.adoc[Building Data Pipelines section].

== Distributed System Tools

Hazelcast offers distributed implementations of standard collections, concurrency utilities and
publish/subscribe messaging model.

Standard collection implementations include Maps, Queues, Lists, Sets and Ringbuffers.
Concurrency utilities include AtomicLongs, AtomicReferences, Semaphores and CountDownLatches.
It also provides a broadcast messaging system based on publish/subscribe model; it lets applications
communicate in real time at high speed. Your applications can write ("publish") to specific channels,
called "topic", and then one or more subscribers can read the messages from that topic. See the
xref:data-structures:distributed-data-structures.adoc[Distributed Data Structures section].

Hazelcast also provides a CP subsystem for distributed coordination use cases such as leader
election, distributed locking, synchronization and metadata management. See the
xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP Subsystem section].

== Querying with SQL

Hazelcast’s SQL engine lets you query static and streaming data. You can load static data
from sources (files and maps) to transform and analyze it. Hazelcast can also load and query
real-time streaming data as it is being generated, which is ideal for use cases that require
complex queries with low latency, e.g., fraud detection. Besides performing transformations
and queries, you can store your transform/query results in one or more systems; it is useful
for sending results to other systems or caching results in Hazelcast to avoid running redundant queries.
