= Add custom JAR files to the classpath

NOTE: We strongly recommend that you use Hazelcast Platform Operator's xref:operator:ROOT:user-code-deployment.adoc[User Code Deployment] feature if you need to add a custom JAR to your Hazelcast members.

If you want to add custom JAR files to Hazelcast Platform and/or Management Center, you can extend the relevant base image and provide your configuration file and/or custom JARs.
To do this, you must create a new `Dockerfile` and build it using the `docker build` command.

The `Dockerfile` example below creates a new image based on the Hazelcast image and adds a custom JAR
from our host to the container, which will be used with Hazelcast when the container runs. 



[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION

# Adding custom JARs to the classpath
ADD custom-library.jar ${HZ_HOME}
----

Build and push the image to your own Docker registry.

[source,bash]
----
docker build -t example/hazelcast .
docker push example/hazelcast
----

You can configure your Helm chart to use the custom image you have built in your `values.yaml`.

[source,yaml]
----
image:
  # repository is the Hazelcast image name
  repository: example/hazelcast
----
