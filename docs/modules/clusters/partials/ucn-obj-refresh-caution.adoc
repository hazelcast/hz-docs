CAUTION: {ucn} can replace resources dynamically, but this does not affect the lifecycle of existing instances using older class versions.
This means that the creation of new objects will use new resources (latest bytecode), but existing objects won't be removed and recreated automatically. In this case, manual intervention is needed, such as destroying and recreating the relevant objects, or restarting Hazelcast members.
This is particularly applicable to long-lived objects tied to the lifecycle of Hazelcast data structures, such as a `MapLoader`: deploying a new version won't replace an existing `MapLoader`, and to refresh such an object, a cluster restart is required.
