= 5.3.0 Release Notes

WARNING: Hazelcast no longer supports JDK 8 as runtime for Hazelcast 5.3.0 and later releases.

== New Features

* **xref:integrate:kafka-connect-connectors.adoc[Connector for Kafka Connect source (BETA)]**: Import data from an external system directly into a Hazelcast data pipeline
without the need of a Kafka cluster.
* **xref:integrate:mongodb-connector.adoc[Connector for MongoDB (BETA)]**: Read and write from/to MongoDB via this connector and execute SQL queries on Mongo collections directly from Hazelcast.
* **https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/docs/design/sql/16-partition-aware-client.md[Partition-Aware SQL Client]**: Send the SQL commands only to the members having the relevant data, which reduces the network hops and improves the query performances.

== Breaking Changes

* Renamed the `DataLinkFactory` interface as `DataConnection`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24224[#24224]
* Changed the default cloud coordinator URL from `coordinator.hazelcast.cloud` to `api.viridian.hazelcast.com`.
The default configuration now connects to https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?utm_source=docs-website[Hazelcast Viridian Cloud^] instead of Hazelcast Cloud.
If you want to continue accessing your Hazelcast Cloud clusters, you need to set the `hazelcast.client.cloud.url` property to `https://coordinator.hazelcast.cloud` in your configuration.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23290[#23290]

== Enhancements

=== Cloud

* Hazelcast was sending requests to Kubernetes API when deploying an application with embedded Hazelcast and `service-dns` (DNS lookup mode) specified to a Kubernetes cluster.
This was causing the requests to be unsuccessful and the application not to start. This mechanism has been improved by creating Kubernetes client only for the DNS lookup mode.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23883[#23883]
* When advanced networking is enabled, the Kubernetes discovery plugin might have been discovering several endpoints (per each port)
for each member's pod. The discovery plugin now matches only the private IP per endpoint, ignoring the port values.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23766[#23766]
* Added support of link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/amazon-machine-images-support-instance-metadata-service-version-2-default/#:~:text=Posted%20On%3A%20Oct%203%2C%202022,depth%20against%20unauthorized%20metadata%20access.[IMDSv2^] for Hazelcast's AWS Discovery plugin.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23545[#23545]
* Added the support of discovering ECS and EC2 members on AWS. See xref:deploy:deploying-on-aws.adoc[Deploying a Cluster on Amazon AWS].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22411[#22411]
* [.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}* Enhanced the experience of using Hazelcast with persistence under Kubernetes by removing requirements for manual interventions. Previously, when there was a restart on such a cluster, the cluster states were needed to be changed manually. For some cases, this might have led to data loss. Now, the shutdown process is automated. See xref:kubernetes:kubernetes-persistence.adoc[Configuring Kubernetes] for details.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/21844[#21844]

=== Storage

* Disk tier option of Tiered Storage is now disabled by default.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23747[#23747]

=== Distribution

* Hazelcast no longer depends on JRuby; the JRuby `ScriptFactory` dependency must be explicitly added to the application.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23355[#23355]
* Added the Kafka Connect extension to the distribution.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23312[#23312]
* Shaded dependencies for Hazelcast Platform have been combined in a dedicated package (`com.hazelcast.shaded`).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23124[#23124]

=== Networking

* Added socket options for per-socket keep-alive configuration: `keep-count`, `keep-idle-seconds`, and `keep-interval-seconds`.
You can set these options using either the advanced network configurations or Hazelcast system properties.
See xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#configuring-tcp-keep-alive[Configuring TCP Keep-Alive].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23816[#23816], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24050[#24050]

=== SQL Engine

* The `CREATE MAPPING` statement for Compact Serialization now supports nullable primitives.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24300[#24300]
* Implemented the `GET_DDL` function.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23595[#23595]
* Implemented the `SHOW DATA CONNECTIONS` statement to show the connections created by the `CREATE CONNECTIONS` statement.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24028[#24028]
* Added support for providing declarative partitioning strategies based on attributes. These attributes represent specific partition keys for a map.
You can also configure this strategy dynamically.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23535[#23535], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23954[#23954]
* Improved the nested loop joins algorithm by making the `CreateDagVisitor` interface generic.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23368[#23368]
* Implemented the `TO_CHAR` function which is capable of formatting dates, timestamps, and numbers.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22529[#22529]
* Implemented `JSON=VARCHAR` comparison.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22746[#22746]

=== Jet Engine

* Each Jet engine job was creating a client for connecting to the remote cluster, resulting in an excessive number of clients.
This has been fixed by introducing a single data connection which can be reused for all job instances.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23472[#23472], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23849[#23849]
* Added MongoDB read (source) and write (sink) processors.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23348[#23348]
* Introduced `JobStatusListener` as an alternative to retrieve a job status via the `Job.getStatus()` method.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23193[#23193]
* Updated the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-latest-supported-java-client}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/Job.html#isUserCancelled--[job API] to add the ability
to distinguish the user-cancelled jobs from the failed ones.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22924[#22924]
* Added `flock` to guard all the concurrent `pip` executions (upgrading `pip` and `protobuf` versions) in the Jet-to-Python script.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22829[#22829]

=== Security

* Added the TLS configuration property `keyMaterialDuration` which allows using a configurable timeout for caching keyStores and trustStores.
See xref:security:tls-configuration.adoc[TLS Configuration] for the details on how to configure this property.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23307[#23307]

=== Serialization

* Hazelcast now allows serializing unsupported types via xref:serialization:compact-serialization.adoc#using-compact-serialization-with-zero-configuration[zero-configuration]
provided that there is an explicit serializer implemented for the unsupported type.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23449[#23449]
* Setting a generic record now fails if the value is not of the same type of generic record.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23522[#23522]
* Introduced clearer exception messages for Generic MapStore, instead of `UndefinedErrorCodeException`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22765[#22765]

=== WAN Replication

* Added the REST endpoint `/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/progress` which allows tracking the WAN synchronization progress.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22958[#22958]

=== Connectors

* Added support for predicates in DML (Data Manipulation Language) in JDBC SQL connector.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24521[#24521]
* Added the ability to provide host, username, password, and authDB when connecting to a MongoDB, as an alternative to specifying a connection string.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24238[#24238]
* Added the ability to create a mapping with a MongoDB data connections that provides unbounded (streaming) results.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24356[#24356]
* Added compound identifier for the `externalName()` method.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23772[#23772]
* Added an option for the MongoDB source to perform reading with a single processor instance. Usually distributing the operations is the best practice; however,
the `$function` aggregation method is not supported by the Atlas Serverless instances. In this case, this newly introduced option can be used to query such instances in one processor. See the option's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v5.3.0/hazelcast-sql/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/sql/impl/connector/mongodb/Options.java#72[documentation].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24198/files[#24198]
* Added additional permission checks to JDBC connectors (source and sink). The previous checks in some cases used only the `jdbc:` name in `ConnectorPermission`.
The newly introduced checks get the JDBC URL from existing connection metadata and check if the permission is granted. If you want to grant a `ConnectorPermission`
to all JDBC URLs, you may use wildcards, e.g., `jdbc:*`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23716[#23716]
* Added `DataConnection` for Kafka consumers and producers, and for MongoDB
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23886[#23886], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23837[#23837]
* Jet engine's connector for MongoDB is now a part of the Hazelcast Platform distribution.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22565[#22565]

=== Metrics

* Added name of the job to the xref:ROOT:list-of-metrics.adoc#jet-engine-job-specific-metrics[job-specific metrics].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23744[#23744]
* Added Tiered Storage compactor metrics to be exposed by the tools and interfaces such as Management Center, JMX, and diagnostics.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23643[#23643]
* Added a new tag to the CP Subsystem metrics to display the client names for CP sessions on Hazelcast Management Center.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23387[#23387]
* Added entry eviction and expiration counts to local map statistics and metrics.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23318[#23318]

=== Other Enhancements

* _External Data Store_ references have been renamed as _Data Connections. This includes the renaming of the `external-data-store` configuration element as `data-connection`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24224[#24224]
* Added the ability to test whether the connection with a JDBC data link is valid (`testConnection` method for `JdbcDataConnection`).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23405[#23405]
* Upgraded Apache Calcite to 1.32.0.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22849[#22849]
* Added confirmation that Hazelcast Platform has been tested on x86_64 and AArch64/ARM64 system architectures from Platform 5.3.

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22256[#22256]

== Upcoming Deprecations

* Hazelcast will end support for Elasticsearch 6 in the upcoming release (5.4). This will affect you if you are using the xref:integrate:elasticsearch-connector.adoc#installing-the-connector[version 6 module of the Elasticsearch connector].

* Hazelcast will deprecate transactions in the upcoming release (5.4). An improved version of this feature is under consideration. If you are already using transactions, get in touch and share your use case. Your feedback will help us to develop a solution that meets your needs.
