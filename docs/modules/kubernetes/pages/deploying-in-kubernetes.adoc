IMPORTANT: For production-grade Kubernetes deployments, we recommend you use Hazelcast Platform Operator.

== Hazelcast Platform Operator for Kubernetes/OpenShift

Kubernetes Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes which help you create and manage your applications. Hazelcast Platform Operator automates common management tasks such as configuring, creating, and scaling Hazelcast clusters on Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift. By taking care of manual deployment and life-cycle management, Hazelcast Platform Operator makes it simpler to work with Hazelcast clusters.

See the https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest/[Hazelcast Platform Operator Documentation] for more information and find details about deploying a Hazelcast cluster in Kubernetes and also connecting clients outside Kubernetes.

== Helm Chart

https://helm.sh/[Helm^] is a package manager for Kubernetes. Hazelcast is distributed in a form of Helm Charts:

* https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast[hazelcast/hazelcast^]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-enterprise[hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise^]

See the xref:kubernetes:helm-hazelcast-chart.adoc[Hazelcast Helm Charts documentation] for more details.
