= What is Hazelcast Platform?
:!page-pagination:
:description: Hazelcast Platform uniquely combines a distributed compute engine and a fast data store in one runtime. It offers unmatched performance, resilience and scale for real-time and AI-driven applications. 

Hazelcast is a distributed computation and storage platform for consistently
low-latency querying, aggregation and stateful computation against event
streams and traditional data sources. {description} It allows you to quickly build
resource-efficient, real-time applications. You can deploy it at any scale
from small edge devices to a large cluster of cloud instances.

Hazelcast can process data on a set of networked and
clustered computers that pool together their random access memories (RAM) to let
applications share data with other applications running in the cluster. When data
is stored in RAM, applications run a lot faster since it does not need to be
retrieved from disk and put into RAM prior to processing. Using Hazelcast,
you can store and process your data in RAM, spread and replicate it across a cluster of
machines; replication gives you resilience to failures of cluster members.

Hazelcast is implemented in Java language and has clients for Java, C++, .NET, REST, Python,
Go and Node.js. Hazelcast also speaks Memcached and REST protocols.

Your cloud-native applications can easily use Hazelcast.
It is flexible enough to use as a data and computing platform out-of-the-box
or as a framework for your own cloud-native applications and microservices.

Hazelcast is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Since it
is delivered as a compact library, it easily
plugs into your software solution.

It is designed to scale up to hundreds of members and thousands of clients.
When you add new members, they automatically discover the cluster
and linearly increase both the memory and
processing capacity. The members maintain a TCP connection between
each other and all communication is performed through
this layer. Each cluster member is configured to be the same in terms
of functionality. The oldest member (the first member created
in the cluster) automatically performs the stored and streaming data assignment to cluster members.
If the oldest member dies, the second oldest member takes over.

Hazelcast offers simple scalability, partitioning (sharding), and re-balancing
out-of-the-box. It does not require any extra coordination processes. NoSQL and
traditional databases are difficult to scale out and manage. They require additional
processes for coordination and high availability. With Hazelcast, when you start
another process to add more capacity, data and backups are automatically and evenly balanced.

== What Can You Do with Hazelcast?

You can request data, listen to events, submit data processing tasks using
Hazelcast clients connected to a cluster. Hazelcast has clients implemented in Java,
.Net, C++, Node.js, Go and Python languages. It also communicates with Memcache and
REST protocols. See the xref:clients:hazelcast-clients.adoc[Hazelcast Clients section].

You can build data pipelines using SQL or the Java API which enable the data to
flow from an application to a data source or from a data source to an analytics database.
A very simple example can be reading words from a file, converting them into all-uppercase,
and output the results to your console. See the xref:pipelines:overview.adoc[Building Data Pipelines section].

You can import data from databases, files, messaging systems, on-premise and cloud systems
in various formats (data ingestion). Hazelcast offers pipelines and loading/storing interfaces for
this purpose. See the xref:ingest:overview.adoc[Ingesting Data section].

You can run queries on the data using SQL in your maps or external systems like Apache Kafka. You can also use
the predicates API to filter and retrieve data in your maps. See the xref:query:overview.adoc[Distributed Queries section].

You can run computational tasks on different cluster members (distributed computing);
for this you can use the pipelines, entry processors, and executor services.
See xref:computing:distributed-computing.adoc[Distributed Computing section].

You can store your data using the distributed implementation of various
data structures like maps, caches, queues, topics, concurrency utilities.
See the xref:data-structures:distributed-data-structures.adoc[Distributed Data Structures section].

You can use it as a distributed second level cache for your Hibernate entities, collections and queries.
Also, Hazelcast can be used as a cache for applications based on the Spring Framework for distributing
shared data in real time.

You can have multiple Hazelcast clusters at different locations in sync
by replicating their state over WAN environments. See the xref:wan:wan.adoc[Synchronizing Data Across a WAN section].

You can listen to the events happening in the cluster, on the data structures and clients so that
you are notified when those events happen. See the xref:events:distributed-events.adoc[Distributed Events section].

Please see the Develop Solutions chapter for all the scenarios you can realize using Hazelcast.

The following are example use cases:

* Increasing the transactions per second and system uptime in payment processing
* Authorizing and authenticating the credit cards using multiple algorithms within milliseconds for fraud detection
* Decreasing order processing times with low latencies in e-commerce
* Being a real-time streamer to detect application performance
* Clustering highly changing data with event notifications, e.g., user based events, and
queueing and distributing background tasks
* Being a distributed topic (publish/subscribe server) to build scalable chat servers for smartphones
* Constructing a strongly consistent layer using its CP
(CP with respect the CAP principle) subsystem built on top of the Raft consensus algorithm
* Distributing user object states across the cluster, to pass messages between objects
and to share system data structures (static initialization state, mirrored objects, object
identity generators)
* Being a multi-tenancy cache where each tenant has its own stored data
* Sharing datasets, e.g., table-like data structure, to be used by applications
* Storing session data in web applications (enabling horizontal scalability of the web application)

The applications call for stored data from data sources, e.g., databases, and these sources
are slow since they are not designed to respond in time. Hazelcast runs in the shared
standard memories (RAMs) of a cluster of servers which sits in between the applications and the datasources.
It gets data from the data sources, pulls it up in the memory and serves it to
the applications at in-memory speeds, instead of RPM speeds. This makes Hazelcast
a low-latency solution (fast response times).

When it comes to streaming data, they come from sources like files, Apache Kafka, IoT and MQ
and they are born in the moment. Hazelcast captures this data in the moment and effectively
processes it on the wire. And this makes Hazelcast a real-time processing platform.

The unique capability of Hazelcast is its ability to process both batch and streaming data,
with low latency and in real-time, enabling transactional and analytical processing.

== Architecture Overview

The fundamental key components of Hazelcast are as follows:

* A *member* is the computational and data storage unit in Hazelcast. Typically
it is a JVM.
* A Hazelcast *cluster* is a set of members communicating with each other. Members which run Hazelcast
automatically discover one another and form a cluster at runtime.
* *Partitions* are the memory segments that store portions of data. They are distributed evenly
among the available cluster members. They can contain hundreds or thousands of data entries each,
depending on the memory capacity of your system. Hazelcast also automatically creates backups of these partitions
which are also distributed in the cluster. This makes Hazelcast resilient to data loss.

NOTE: _Node_ and _Member_ are interchangeable, and both mean a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on which one or more instances of Hazelcast are in operation.

Hazelcast's *streaming engine* focuses on data transformation while it does all the heavy
lifting of getting the data flowing and computation running across a cluster of members.
It supports working with both bounded (batch) and unbounded (streaming) data.

Hazelcast's *storage engine* is the distributed, fast, and operational data store dealing with
persistence of data.

Hazelcast comes out of the box with different sources and sinks. *Sources* are where Hazelcast
pulls the data, and *sinks* are where it outputs the processed data result. Sources and sinks
are also referred to as *connectors*. Its unified connector API provides a simple way to read files,
unified across different sources of the data. See the xref:pipelines:sources-sinks.adoc[Sources and Sinks section]
for more information about the unified connector API and the supported sources and sinks.
