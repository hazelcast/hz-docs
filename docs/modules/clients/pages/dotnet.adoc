TIP: For latest .NET API documentation, see http://hazelcast.github.io/hazelcast-csharp-client/{page-latest-supported-csharp-client}/api/index.html[Hazelcast .NET Client docs].

You can use the native .NET client to connect to Hazelcast client members.
The API is very similar to the Java native client.

See Hazelcast .NET client's GitHub http://hazelcast.github.io/hazelcast-csharp-client/latest/doc/download-install.html[documentation^]
for more information about configuring, starting, and using the client.
You can also find https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client/tree/master/src/Hazelcast.Net.Examples[code samples^]
for the client in this repo.
