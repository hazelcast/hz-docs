= Start a Local Enterprise Cluster
:description: This section guides you to start a Hazelcast Enterprise cluster with multiple members, and create a map.

{description} We are going to use Docker.

In this tutorial, you will:

. Start a Hazelcast Enterprise cluster with three members
. Create a map with data in it
. Connect Management Center to the cluster

== Before You Begin

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

|Docker network with the name `hazelcast-network`
|Use the `docker network create hazelcast-network` command 

|===

== Step 1. Start a Local Enterprise Member

In this step, you use the Hazelcast Enterprise Docker image to start a local single-member cluster called `hello-world`.
This step also installs your Enterprise license key.

Run the following command on the terminal:

[source,shell]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    --rm \
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=hello-world \
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your license key> \
    -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:5.0
----

You should see your cluster name in the console along with the IP address of the member:

== Step 2. Start the Other Members

In this step, you add two more Enterprise members to the `hello-world` cluster.

Open a new terminal and execute the Docker `run` command again to start another member.

[source,shell]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    --rm \
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=hello-world \
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your license key> \
    -p 5702:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:5.0
----

Start the third member on another new terminal.

[source,shell]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    --rm \
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=hello-world \
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your license key> \
    -p 5703:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:5.0
----

You should see that three members find and connect to each other automatically to form the `hello-world` cluster.
You can learn more about how members do this in xref:clusters:discovery-mechanisms.adoc[].

== Step 3. Create a Map

In this step you switch to the SQL shell, create a map called `my-distributed-map` and put data into it.

. In a new terminal window, start the SQL shell; you are going to run commands in the SQL shell after this step.
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run --network hazelcast-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:5.0 hz-cli --targets hello-world@<IP address of one of the members> sql
----
. Create the map.
+
[source,shell]
----
CREATE MAPPING my_distributed_map TYPE IMap OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='varchar','valueFormat'='varchar');
----
. Add data to the map.
+
[source,shell]
----
SINK INTO my_distributed_map VALUES
('1', 'John'),
('2', 'Mary'),
('3', 'Jane');
----
. Exit the SQL shell using the `exit` command.

You can again switch back to the SQL shell or use a client to get the data in the map; see xref:getting-started:get-started-docker#step-3-read-data-from-memory[Read Data from Memory].

== Step 4. Set up Management Center

In this step, you start a local instance of Management Center and use it to view your cluster’s statistics.

. Start Management Center
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:latest-snapshot
----
. In a web browser, go to localhost:8080 and enable Dev Mode.
+
image:mc-dev-mode.png[Enabling dev mode in Management center]
. You will see a "Connect" box on the screen; click on it and enter your cluster's name (`hello-world`) and IP addresses of three members.
+
image:connect-cluster.png[Connecting Management Center to the cluster]
. You should see that you cluster is in an active state and has three members.

You can now monitor your:

* cluster (go to **Cluster > Dashboard** in Management Center)
* members (**Cluster > Members**)
* the map you've just created (**Storage > Maps**).
