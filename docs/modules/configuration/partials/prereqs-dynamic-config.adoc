You can add new configuration only for some features. See xref:dynamic-data-structure-configuration.adoc#supported-configuration[Supported Configuration].

NOTE: You can only add new configuration. You cannot use dynamic configuration to override existing configuration at runtime.

Dynamic configuration changes are not persisted by default. See xref:configuration:dynamic-data-structure-configuration.adoc#persist[Persisting Configuration Changes]
