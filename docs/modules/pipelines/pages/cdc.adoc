= Capture Changes from MySQL

In this tutorial, you will learn how to process change events from a
MySQL database.

== Step 1. Install Docker

This tutorial uses link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker] to simplify the
setup of a MySQL database, which you can freely experiment on.

. Follow Docker's link:https://www.docker.com/get-started[Get Started]
   instructions and install it on your system.

. Test that it works:
   * Run `docker version` to check that you have the latest release
     installed.
   * Run `docker run hello-world` to verify that Docker is pulling
     images and running as expected.

== Step 2. Start MySQL Database

Open a terminal, and run following command. It will start a new
container that runs a MySQL database server preconfigured with an
inventory database:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it --rm --name mysql -p 3306:3306 \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=debezium -e MYSQL_USER=mysqluser \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysqlpw debezium/example-mysql:2.6
----

This runs a new container using version `2.6` of the
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/example-mysql[debezium/example-mysql]
image (based on link:https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql[mysql 8.2]. It defines
and populates a sample "inventory" database and creates a `debezium`
user with password `dbz` that has the minimum privileges required by
Debezium’s MySQL connector.

The command assigns the name `mysql` to the container so that it can be
easily referenced later. The `-it` flag makes the container interactive,
meaning it attaches the terminal’s standard input and output to the
container so that you can see what is going on in the container. The
`--rm` flag instructs Docker to remove the container when it is stopped.

The command maps port `3306` (the default MySQL port) in the container
to the same port on the Docker host so that software outside the
container can connect to the database server.

Finally, it also uses the `-e` option three times to set the
`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_USER`, and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` environment
variables to specific values.

You should see in your terminal something like the following:

[source,text]
----
...
2020-03-09T09:48:24.579480Z 0 [Note] mysqld: ready for connections.
Version: '5.7.29-log'  socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'  port: 3306  MySQL Community Server (GPL)
----

Notice that the MySQL server starts and stops a few times as the
configuration is modified. The last line listed above reports that the
MySQL server is running and ready for use.

== Step 3. Start the MySQL Command Line Client

Open a new terminal, and use it to start a new container for the MySQL
command line client and connect it to the MySQL server running in the
`mysql` container:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it --rm --name mysqlterm --link mysql --rm mysql:5.7 sh \
    -c 'exec mysql -h"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR" -P"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT" -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"'
----

Here we start the container using the `mysql:5.7` image, name the
container `mysqlterm` and link it to the mysql container where the
database server is running.

The `--rm` option tells Docker to remove the container when it stops,
and the rest of the command defines the shell command that the container
should run. This shell command runs the MySQL command line client and
specifies the correct options so that it can connect properly.

The container should output lines similar to the following:

[source]
----
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4

mysql>
----

Unlike the other containers, this container runs a process that produces
a prompt. We’ll use the prompt to interact with the database. First,
switch to the "inventory" database:

[source,sql]
----
mysql> use inventory;
----

and then list the tables in the database:

[source,sql]
----
mysql> show tables;
----

which should then display:

[source]
----
+---------------------+
| Tables_in_inventory |
+---------------------+
| addresses           |
| customers           |
| geom                |
| orders              |
| products            |
| products_on_hand    |
+---------------------+
6 rows in set (0.01 sec)
----

Use the MySQL command line client to explore the database and view the
preloaded data. For example:

[source,sql]
----
mysql> SELECT * FROM customers;
----

== Step 4. Start Hazelcast

. xref:getting-started:install-hazelcast.adoc[Download Hazelcast].
+
If you already have Hazelcast and you skipped the above steps, make sure to
follow from here on.
ifdef::snapshot[]
Download and extract the Hazelcast ZIP file from link:https://repository.hazelcast.com/snapshot/com/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-distribution/{full-version}[the repository].
. Make sure the MySQL CDC plugin is in the `lib/` directory. You must manually download the MySQL CDC plugin's `jar-with-dependencies` from link:https://repository.hazelcast.com/snapshot/com/hazelcast/jet/hazelcast-enterprise-cdc-mysql/{full-version}[Hazelcast's Maven repository, window=_blank] and then copy it to the `lib/` directory.
endif::[]
ifndef::snapshot[]
. Make sure the MySQL CDC plugin is in the `lib/` directory. You must manually download the MySQL CDC plugin from link:https://repository.hazelcast.com/release/com/hazelcast/jet/hazelcast-enterprise-cdc-mysql/{full-version}/hazelcast-enterprise-cdc-mysql-{full-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar[Hazelcast's Maven repository, window=_blank] and then copy it to the `lib/` directory.
endif::[]
+
[source,bash]
----
ls lib/
----
+
You should see the following jars:
+
* hazelcast-enterprise-cdc-debezium-{full-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* hazelcast-enterprise-cdc-mysql-{full-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* hazelcast-enterprise-cdc-postgres-{full-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar
+
WARNING: If you have Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}, you need to manually download the MySQL CDC plugin from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/jet/hazelcast-jet-cdc-mysql/{os-version}/hazelcast-jet-cdc-mysql-{os-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar[Hazelcast's Maven repository] and then copy it to the `lib/` directory.

. Start Hazelcast.
+
[source,bash]
----
bin/hz-start
----

. When you see output like this, Hazelcast is up:

== Step 5. Create a New Java Project

We'll assume you're using an IDE. Create a blank Java project named
`cdc-tutorial` and copy the Gradle or Maven file into it:

== Step 6. Define a Data Pipeline

Let's write the code that will monitor the database and do something
useful with the data it sees. We will only monitor the `customers` table
and use the change events coming from it to maintain an up-to-date view
of all current customers.

By up-to-date view we mean an `IMap` keyed by customer ID and who's
values are `Customer` data objects containing all information for a
customer with a specific ID.

This is how the code doing this looks like:

[source,java]
----
package org.example;

import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import com.hazelcast.enterprise.jet.cdc.CdcSinks;
import com.hazelcast.enterprise.jet.cdc.ChangeRecord;
import com.hazelcast.enterprise.jet.cdc.mysql.MySqlCdcSources;
import com.hazelcast.jet.config.JobConfig;
import com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.Pipeline;
import com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.StreamSource;

public class JetJob {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StreamSource<ChangeRecord> source = MySqlCdcSources.mysql("source")
                .setDatabaseAddress("127.0.0.1", 3306)
                .setDatabaseCredentials("debezium", "dbz")
                .setClusterName("dbserver1")
                .setDatabaseIncludeList("inventory")
                .setTableIncludeList("inventory.customers")
                .build();

        Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create();
        pipeline.readFrom(source)
                .withoutTimestamps()
                .peek()
                .writeTo(CdcSinks.map("customers",
                        r -> r.key().toMap().get("id"),
                        r -> r.value().toObject(Customer.class).toString()));

        JobConfig cfg = new JobConfig().setName("mysql-monitor");
        HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.bootstrappedInstance();
        hz.getJet().newJob(pipeline, cfg);
    }

}
----

NOTE: If you are using Hazelcast {open-source-product-name}, you have to change the package from `com.hazelcast.enterprise.jet...` to `com.hazelcast.jet...`.

The `Customer` class we map change events to is quite simple too:

[source,java]
----
package org.example;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Objects;

public class Customer implements Serializable {

    @JsonProperty("id")
    public int id;

    @JsonProperty("first_name")
    public String firstName;

    @JsonProperty("last_name")
    public String lastName;

    @JsonProperty("email")
    public String email;

    public Customer() {
    }

    public Customer(int id, String firstName, String lastName, String email) {
        super();
        this.id = id;
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.email = email;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(email, firstName, id, lastName);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) {
            return true;
        }
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
            return false;
        }
        Customer other = (Customer) obj;
        return id == other.id
                && Objects.equals(firstName, other.firstName)
                && Objects.equals(lastName, other.lastName)
                && Objects.equals(email, other.email);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Customer {id=" + id + ", firstName=" + firstName + ", lastName=" + lastName + ", email=" + email + '}';
    }
}
----

To make it evident that our pipeline serves the purpose of building an
up-to-date cache of customers, which can be interrogated at any time
let's add one more class. This code can be executed at any time in your
IDE and will print the current content of the cache.

[source,java]
----
package org.example;

import com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;

public class CacheRead {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HazelcastInstance instance = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient();

        System.out.println("Currently there are following customers in the cache:");
        instance.getMap("customers").values().forEach(c -> System.out.println("\t" + c));

        instance.shutdown();
    }

}
----

== Step 7. Package the Pipeline into a JAR

Now that we have all the pieces, we need to submit it to Hazelcast for
execution. Since Hazelcast runs on our machine as a standalone cluster in a
standalone process we need to give it all the code that we have written.

For this reason we create a jar containing everything we need. All we
need to do is to run the build command:

[tabs] 
==== 
Gradle:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,bash]
----
gradle build
----

This will produce a JAR file called `cdc-tutorial-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
in the `build/libs` directory of our project.
--
Maven:: 
+ 
-- 

[source,bash]
----
mvn package
----

This will produce a JAR file called `cdc-tutorial-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
in the `target` directory or our project.
--
====

== Step 8. Submit the Job for Execution

Assuming our cluster is <<4-start-hazelcast-jet, still running>> and the database <<2-start-mysql-database, is up>>, all we need to
issue is following command:

[tabs] 
==== 
Gradle:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,bash]
----
bin/hz-cli submit build/libs/cdc-tutorial-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----
--
Maven:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,bash]
----
bin/hz-cli submit target/cdc-tutorial-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----
--
====

The output in the Hazelcast member's log should look something like this (we
also log what we put in the `IMap` sink thanks to the `peek()` stage
we inserted):

[source]
----
... Completed snapshot in 00:00:01.519
... Output to ordinal 0: key:{{"id":1001}}, value:{{"id":1001,"first_name":"Sally","last_name":"Thomas",...
... Output to ordinal 0: key:{{"id":1002}}, value:{{"id":1002,"first_name":"George","last_name":"Bailey",...
... Output to ordinal 0: key:{{"id":1003}}, value:{{"id":1003,"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"Walker",...
... Output to ordinal 0: key:{{"id":1004}}, value:{{"id":1004,"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"Kretchmar",...
... Transitioning from the snapshot reader to the binlog reader
----

== Step 9. Track Updates

Let's see how our cache looks like at this time. If we execute the
 `CacheRead` code <<6-define-jet-job, defined above>>, we'll get:

[source,text]
----
Currently there are following customers in the cache:
    Customer {id=1002, firstName=George, lastName=Bailey, email=gbailey@foobar.com}
    Customer {id=1003, firstName=Edward, lastName=Walker, email=ed@walker.com}
    Customer {id=1004, firstName=Anne, lastName=Kretchmar, email=annek@noanswer.org}
    Customer {id=1001, firstName=Sally, lastName=Thomas, email=sally.thomas@acme.com}
----

Let's do some updates in our database. Go to the MySQL CLI
<<step-3-start-the-mysql-command-line-client, we've started earlier>> and run
following update statement:

[source,bash]
----
mysql> UPDATE customers SET first_name='Anne Marie' WHERE id=1004;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
----

In the log of the Hazelcast member we should immediately see the effect:

[source]
----
... Output to ordinal 0: key:{{"id":1004}}, value:{{"id":1004,"first_name":"Anne Marie","last_name":"Kretchmar",...
----

If we check the cache with `CacheRead` we get:

[source]
----
Currently there are following customers in the cache:
    Customer {id=1002, firstName=George, lastName=Bailey, email=gbailey@foobar.com}
    Customer {id=1003, firstName=Edward, lastName=Walker, email=ed@walker.com}
    Customer {id=1004, firstName=Anne Marie, lastName=Kretchmar, email=annek@noanswer.org}
    Customer {id=1001, firstName=Sally, lastName=Thomas, email=sally.thomas@acme.com}
----

One more:

[source,bash]
----
mysql> UPDATE customers SET email='edward.walker@walker.com' WHERE id=1003;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
----

[source]
----
Currently there are following customers in the cache:
    Customer {id=1002, firstName=George, lastName=Bailey, email=gbailey@foobar.com}
    Customer {id=1003, firstName=Edward, lastName=Walker, email=edward.walker@walker.com}
    Customer {id=1004, firstName=Anne Marie, lastName=Kretchmar, email=annek@noanswer.org}
    Customer {id=1001, firstName=Sally, lastName=Thomas, email=sally.thomas@acme.com}
----

== Step 10. Clean up

. Cancel the job.
+
[source,bash]
----
bin/hz-cli cancel mysql-monitor
----
+
Shut down the Hazelcast cluster.
+
[source,bash]
----
bin/hz-stop
----
. Use Docker to stop the running container (this will kill the
command-line client too, since it's running in the same container):
+
[source,bash]
----
docker stop mysql
----
+
Since we've used the `--rm` flag when starting the connectors,
Docker should remove them right after we stop them.
We can verify that all processes are stopped and removed with following
command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker ps -a
----
