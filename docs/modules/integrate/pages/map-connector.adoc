= Map Connector
:description: A map is a distributed in-memory key-value data structure that can be used as a batch or streaming data source as well as a data sink.

A map is a distributed in-memory key-value data structure that can be used as a batch or streaming data source as well as a data sink. See xref:data-structures:map.adoc[].

== Installing the Connector

This connector is included in the full and slim
distributions of Hazelcast.

== Permissions
[.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*

If xref:security:enable-security.adoc[security] is enabled, you can set up permissions to restrict clients' access to these data structures.

For example, to read from map sources, you must add the `create` and `read` permissions for those maps. If you use the map connector to write to map sinks, you must add the `create` and `put` permissions for those maps.

For details, see xref:security:client-authorization.adoc[].

== Map as a Batch Source

Use maps as a batch source to query their keys and values or use them as part of a data pipeline.

As a batch data source, it's very easy to use without the need for any other
configuration:

```java
IMap<String, User> userCache = hz.getMap("usersCache")
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(Sources.map(userCache));
 .writeTo(Sinks.logger()));
```

== Map as a Streaming Source

Maps can also be used as a streaming data source by enabling the xref:data-structures:event-journal.adoc[event journal].

Streaming data from maps is fault-tolerant and supports exactly-once
processing.

The journal for a map is by default not enabled,
but can be enabled with the following configuration option:

We can then modify the previous pipeline to instead stream the changes:


```java
IMap<String, User> userCache = hz.getMap("usersCache")
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(Sources.mapJournal(userCache, START_FROM_OLDEST))
 .withIngestionTimestamps()
 .writeTo(Sinks.logger()));
```

By default, the source will emit only `ADDED` or `UPDATED` events and
the emitted object will have the key and the new value. You can change
to listen for all events by adding additional parameters to the source.

The capacity of the event journal is also an important consideration, as
having too little capacity will cause events to be dropped. Consider
also that the capacity is for all partitions and not shared per partition.
For example, if there are many updates to just one key, with the default
partition count of `271` and journal size of `100,000` the journal only
has space for `370` events per partitions.

For a tutorial, see the xref:pipelines:stream-imap.adoc[].

== Map as a Sink

By default, the map sink expects items of type `Entry<Key, Value>` and
will simply replace the previous entries, if any. However, there are
variants of the map sink that allow you to do atomic updates to existing
entries in the map by making use of `EntryProcessor` objects.

The updating sinks come in three variants:

- `mapWithMerging`, where you provide a function that computes the map value from the stream item and a merging function that gets called
only if a value already exists in the map. This is similar to the way
standard `Map.merge` method behaves. Here’s an example that
concatenates String values:
+
```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(Sources.<String, User>map("userCache"))
 .map(user -> entry(user.country(), user))
 .writeTo(Sinks.mapWithMerging("usersByCountry",
    e -> e.getKey(),
    e -> e.getValue().name(),
    (oldValue, newValue) -> oldValue + ", " + newValue)
  );
```

- `mapWithUpdating`, where you provide a single updating function that
always gets called. It will be called on the stream item and the
existing value, if any. This can be used to add details to an
existing object for example. This is similar to the way standard
`Map.compute` method behaves. Here's an example that only updates a
field:
+
[source,java]
----
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(Sources.<String, User>map("userCacheDetails"))
 .writeTo(Sinks.mapWithUpdating("userCache",
    e -> e.getKey(),
    (oldValue, entry) -> (oldValue != null ? oldValue.setDetails(entry.getValue) : null)
  ))
----

- `mapWithEntryProcessor`, where you provide a function that returns a
full-blown `EntryProcessor` instance that will be submitted to the
map. This is the most general variant. This example takes the
values of the map and submits an entry processor that increments the
values by 5:
+
```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(Sources.<String, Integer>map("input"))
 .writeTo(Sinks.mapWithEntryProcessor("output",
    entry -> entry.getKey(),
    entry -> new IncrementEntryProcessor())
  );

static class IncrementEntryProcessor implements EntryProcessor<String, Integer, Integer> {
    @Override
    public Integer process(Entry<String, Integer> entry) {
        return entry.setValue(entry.getValue() + 5);
    }
}
```

The variants above can be used to remove existing map entries by
setting their values to `null`. To put it another way, if these map sink
variants set the entry’s value to null, the entry will be removed
from the map.

NOTE: Custom classes, such as an `EntryProcessor`, must be available to all members
of the cluster. This can be done by adding the classes to each member's classpath
directly, or by using {ucn}. If using {ucn}, ensure that the Job and underlying IMap
are both associated with a namespace that contains the same `EntryProcessor` implementation.

== Predicates and Projections

If your use case calls for some filtering and/or transformation of the
data you retrieve, you can optimize the pipeline by providing a
filtering predicate and an arbitrary transformation function to the
source connector itself and they’ll get applied before the data is
processed by Hazelcast. This can be advantageous especially in the cases when
the data source is in another cluster. See the example below:

```java
IMap<String, Person> personCache = jet.getMap("personCache");
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(Sources.map(personCache,
    Predicates.greaterEqual("age", 21),
    Projections.singleAttribute("name"))
);
```
