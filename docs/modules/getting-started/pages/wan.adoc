= Replicate a Map over Clusters in a WAN
:description: This tutorial introduces you to WAN Replication by replicating map entries across two clusters: London and Tokyo. At the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to synchronize a map from one cluster to another.
:page-enterprise: true

{description}

WAN Replication can work in two modes. This tutorial uses active-passive mode.

* Active-Passive: An active cluster replicates its maps and/or caches to one or more passive clusters
for the purpose of maintaining a backup. If the active cluster becomes unavailable, you can redirect the application traffic to the passive cluster.
* Active-Active: Each cluster replicates maps and/or caches to all other clusters.


In this tutorial, you will complete the following steps:

. Start a passive {enterprise-product-name} cluster, without WAN Replication, which will receive updates from the active cluster.
. Start an active cluster, with WAN Replication configured, which will send updates to the passive cluster.
. Create a map in the active cluster and see that the entries are replicated on the passive cluster.
. Modify some map entries in the active cluster and see the modifications appear in the passive one.

== Before You Begin

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Prerequisites|Useful resources

|Docker image for Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} and an {enterprise-product-name} license
|xref:getting-started:enterprise-overview.adoc[]

|Docker network with the name `hazelcast-network`
|Use the `docker network create hazelcast-network` command 

|===

== Step 1. Start the Passive Cluster

In this step you'll start an {enterprise-product-name} cluster called `london` with a single member. This will be the **passive** cluster
which means it does not need WAN Replication to be configured. Run the following Docker command in a terminal.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    -e HZ_NETWORK_PUBLICADDRESS=<host_ip>:5701 \ <1>
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your license key> \ <2>
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=london \
    hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{ee-version}
----
<1> Replace the `<host_ip>` placeholder with the IP address of your Docker host.
<2> Replace the `<your license key>` placeholder with your Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} license key.

The member is up and running now.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
2021-11-23 11:08:15,055 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.i.c.ClusterService]: [172.18.0.3]:5701 [london] [{full-version}]

	Member [172.18.0.3]:5701 - bed20746-1505-449b-9f4a-548bcdbe12b8 this
]
----

== Step 2. Start the Active Cluster

Now you'll start another {enterprise-product-name} cluster called `tokyo` with a single member. This will be the **active** cluster
which means it needs WAN Replication to be configured.

Since the configuration for WAN Replication is a bit more detailed, you are going to use a Hazelcast configuration
file and pass it to the Docker command, instead of giving all the configuration options in a single command.

. Create a `hazelcast.yaml` (or XML) configuration file with the following content and place it in `~/config-tokyo` directory.
+

    <map name="cities">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep">
    </map>
</hazelcast>
----
====
. Open a new terminal and start the active cluster.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
     --network hazelcast-network \
     -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dhazelcast.config=/opt/hazelcast/config_ext/hazelcast.yaml" -v ~/config-tokyo:/opt/hazelcast/config_ext hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{ee-version}
----

Here is your other single-member cluster:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
2021-11-23 11:39:14,198 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.i.c.ClusterService]: [172.18.0.4]:5701 [tokyo] [{full-version}] 

Members {size:1, ver:1} [
	Member [172.18.0.4]:5701 - 98d9a815-5eb3-4341-bec1-e9816cee44b5 this
]
----

Note the member's IP address and port since you are going to use it while connecting Management Center.

== Step 3. Set Up Management Center

. Start Management Center
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:{full-version}
----
. Once you see the `Hazelcast Management Center successfully started at http://localhost:8080/` log in the terminal, open a web browser, go to localhost:8080, and enable Dev Mode.
. You will see a **Connect** box on the screen; click on it and enter the passive cluster’s name (`london`) and IP address of its member.
+
image:wan/connect-london-cluster.png[Connect the London cluster]
Management Center is now connected to the `london` cluster.
. Click **Connect** again and enter the active cluster’s name (`tokyo`) and the IP address of its member.
+
image:wan/cluster-connected.png[Both clusters are connected]
Management Center is now connected to the `tokyo` cluster.
. You need to provide your license key; this is needed since you are going to use the WAN Replication feature for the `tokyo` cluster in Management Center.
Click on **View Cluster** for `tokyo`, go to **Settings** located on the very top right of the user interface and, select **License**.
+
image:wan/provide-license.png[Enter your license key]
Type in your license key and click on **Update License**. Close the license screen.
. Verify that the `tokyo` cluster has WAN Replication enabled. Go to **Cluster > WAN Replication**.
+

== Step 4. Create a Map

In this step you switch to the SQL shell in a terminal, create a map called `cities` for the `tokyo` cluster, and put data into it.

. In a new terminal, start the SQL shell that will be connected to the `tokyo` cluster.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --network hazelcast-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version} hz-cli --targets tokyo@172.18.0.4:5701 sql
----
. Once you see the SQL shell (`sql>`), type the following command and press kbd:[Enter] to create the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING cities (__key INT, country VARCHAR, city VARCHAR)
TYPE IMap 
OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='int', 'valueFormat' = 'json-flat');
----
. Then, type the following command and press kbd:[Enter] to add data to the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO cities VALUES
(1,'Australia','Canberra'),
(2,'Croatia','Zagreb'),
(3,'Czech Republic','Prague'),
(4,'England','London'),
(5,'Turkey','Ankara'),
(6,'United States','Washington, DC');
----
. See the entries by running the following query.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM cities;
----

You can also see the map and its entries in Management Center, using the SQL browser:

. Select *tokyo* in the dropdown field left to *Cluster Connections* on top of the user interface.
. Go to **Storage** > **Maps**, you will see the `cities` map information.
+
image:wan/map-tokyo.png[Cities map in Tokyo cluster]
. Click on **SQL Browser** located on the very top right of the user interface and choose `cities` in the *select a map* field.
The SQL browser then shows the default query in its editor, `SELECT * FROM cities;`. 
. Click on **Execute Query**; you will see the data you've put in. 
+
image:wan/map-entries.png[Management Center's SQL Browser shows the map data]
. Close the SQL browser.

== Step 5. Verify the Replication

With WAN Replication enabled, your `cities` map and its data should have been replicated from the active cluster (`tokyo`)
to the passive one (`london`). In this step, you'll verify that the `cities` map now also exists in the `london` cluster.

. In Management Center, select *london* in the dropdown field left to *Cluster Connections* on top of the user interface.
. Go to *Storage* > *Maps* and see that the *cities* map is there.

Additionally, you can query the map entries on the `london` cluster using the SQL browser in Management Center.

. You first need to create the mapping so that the `london` cluster can read the map entries.
Open the SQL browser, type in the following query.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING cities (__key INT, country VARCHAR, city VARCHAR)
TYPE IMap 
OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='int', 'valueFormat' = 'json-flat');
----
. Click **Execute Query**.
+
image:wan/create-mapping-london.png[Create mapping on the London cluster]
. In the `select a map` field, choose `cities`. The editor shows the default `SELECT * FROM cities;` query. Once you execute it, you will see the entries of `cities` map, as in Step 4.
. Close the SQL browser.

== Step 6. Update a Map Entry on the Active Cluster

In this step, you'll update an entry in the `cities` map on the active cluster (`tokyo`) and verify the update is replicated to the passive one (`london`).

. Select *tokyo* in the dropdown field left to *Cluster Connections* on top of the user interface and go to **SQL Browser**.
. Choose *cities* in the *select a map* field and execute the default `SELECT * FROM "cities"` query.
+
image:wan/entry-tobe-modified.png[]
. Now, you are going to modify the data shown above in the red box (the entry having the key `1`). In the SQL editor, delete the default query and type in the following command.
+
[source,sql]
----
SINK INTO cities VALUES
(1, 'Austria', 'Vienna');
----
Execute the query and see the entry has changed.
+
image:wan/entry-modified.png[Data is modified]
. Close the SQL browser and now go to the passive cluster (`london`) by choosing *london* in the dropdown field left to *Cluster Connections* on top of the user interface.
. Open the SQL browser, choose *cities* in the *select a map* field and execute the default query.
. You will see the entry having the key `1` is also modified.

In this step, you have seen that a data modification in the active cluster is immediately replicated to the passive one.
If you do the modification first on the passive cluster, you'd see that the modification is not applied to the active one.

== Step 7. Shut Down the Cluster

Shut down the cluster you've created in this tutorial so that you can start a fresh one when you
move to the other tutorials. To shut down, close the terminals in which the members are running or press kbd:[Ctrl+C] in each terminal.
