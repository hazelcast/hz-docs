= 5.4.0 Release Notes

CAUTION: Starting with this release of Hazelcast Platform, the minimum supported Java version is 17.

== New Features

* [.enterprise]*Enterprise* **User Code Namespaces**: Enable deployment and redeployment of your custom classes. See the xref:clusters:user-code-namespaces.adoc[User Code Namespaces documentation].
* [.enterprise]*Enterprise* **Thread-Per-Core (TPC)**: TPC is now generally available. You can enable this feature on the clients and cluster members for improved performance. See the xref:cluster-performance:thread-per-core-tpc.adoc[Thread-Per-Core (TPC) documentation].
* [.enterprise]*Enterprise* **CPMap**:  Added CPMap as a minimal key-value CP data structure. See xref:data-structures:cpmap.adoc[CPMap documentation].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25802[#25802]

== Breaking Changes

* The `MergingValue` interface within the SPI package now requires the `getDeserializedValue()` method to be defined within implementations, replacing the `getValue()` definition.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25942[#25942]
* Moved the MongoDB connector to the extensions module, that is, its classes and related dependencies relocated;
if you are using Maven to install the connector, you must add `<classifier>jar-with-dependencies</classifier>` to your `pom.xml`.
Also removed the permissions for MongoDB connector.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25744[#25744], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25701[#25701]
* Method names used as parameters in https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/SecurityInterceptor.html[`SecurityInterceptor`] checks were reviewed and unified into a single place  - class `com.hazelcast.security.SecurityInterceptorConstants`. Some client messages have the method name changed to reflect their purpose better. Some client messages are newly covered by `SecurityInterceptor` checks now.
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25020[#25020]
* Renamed the service port for Hazelcast clusters deployed in Kubernetes environments to `hazelcast`.
The previous name, `hazelcast-service-port`, caused member auto-discovery for embedded deployments to fail.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24834[#24834], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24705[#24705], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24688[#24688]
* Fixed an issue where Hazelcast was not failing fast when a member is started with a blank public address. This has been fixed by introducing a configuration validation
that might break any existing, but invalid, configuration.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24729[#24729]

== Enhancements

=== SQL/Jet Engine

* Removed the beta annotations from the data connection classes.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/26000[#26000]
* Replaced the user-defined types (UDTs) feature flag with the cyclic UDT feature flag, to prevent querying such type data.

* Added support for loading and storing a single column as the value using the `GenericMapStore`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25878[#25878]
* Each Jet engine job was creating a client for connecting to the remote cluster, resulting in an excessive number of clients. This has been fixed by introducing a single data connection, which can be reused for all job instances.

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/21546[#21546]
* Added the new user code module (`UserCodeTransforms`) to run user codes in containerized environments. Currently, the module can be used with the Jet engine to create mappings with the user codes. #6464
* Added a new UDP socket connector processor (`StreamUDPSocketP`) which can be used as a streaming source.
It accepts a transform function to be applied to the body of the datagram packet before moving it to downstream. #6161

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25305[#25305]
* Added the `demoteLocalDataMember()` method to convert members holding data to lite members, enabling a cluster to be alive while there is no data in it.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24617[#24617]
* Improved the duration of joins by the clients to the cluster; the clients can now join instantaneously without waiting by internally delaying the migrations asynchronously.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17582[#17582]

=== Serialization

* Added the ability to use consistent serialization service for `ByKey` plans.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25631[#25631]
* Serialization service is not created anymore for light jobs as it creates overhead and generates garbage. #235, #449

=== Cloud

* Enhanced the warning message shown in the cases of incorrect configurations when deploying a Hazelcast client on Amazon EKS.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25568[#25568]

=== Events and Listeners

* Added the `onCancel()` method to the reliable message listener to trigger a notification when the listener is cancelled for any reason. #286

=== REST API

* Added the new `RestConfig` tag under the server `Config`; it allows configuration of the new REST API server. #508
* Added the health check endpoints for the new REST API; these include state of the members and cluster, and the member count. #192

=== Distribution

* Improved the binary scripts of Hazelcast Platform for Windows operating systems.
** `common.bat` has been updated to not include excessive spaces in parameters.
** `hz-cli.bat` and `hz-start.bat` have been updated to reference the `common.bat` script with correct paths.
