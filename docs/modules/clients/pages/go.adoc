The Hazelcast native Go client is an official library that allows Go applications to connect to and interact with Hazelcast clusters. It is implemented using the Hazelcast Open Binary Client Protocol. The key features and benefits include:

* Distributed Data Structures: supports various distributed implementations like Map, Queue, Set, List, MultiMap, and Replicated Map, mimicking natural interfaces of these structures in Go
* SQL Support: allows running SQL queries on Hazelcast 5.x clusters, enhancing data querying capabilities
* JSON Support: declarative configuration support via JSON
* High Performance: offers high-performance aggregation functions such as sum, average, max, and min, for Hazelcast Map entries. They can run in parallel for each partition and are highly optimized for speed and low-memory consumption
* Near Cache: improves read performance for frequently accessed data, optimizing application speed
* External Smart Client Discovery: allows for dynamic discovery of cluster members, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance

The Hazelcast Go client provides a robust, efficient, and Go-friendly way to work with Hazelcast clusters, enabling developers to build scalable and distributed applications with ease.
