== Enhancements
* **Added IPv6 support to the AWS discovery plugin**: The AWS discovery plugin now supports IPv6 by checking for an `ipv6address`` field in the instance description and adding an extra entry for private-to-public mapping as (`ipv6address`, `ipv6address`). If the client is inside AWS, it will prioritize using the private IPv6, which ensures better connectivity in IPv6-enabled environments.
* **Updated BouncyCastle to support FIPS compliance**: Hazelcast now supports FIPS-compliant mode with an updated BouncyCastle implementation. Previously, a public key used by Hazelcast was not endorsed in FIPS-approved mode under BouncyCastle version 2.0.0.
* **Enhanced error message received by clients using FencedLock**: During a CP Subsystem reset, clients using FencedLock previously received a `NotLeaderException` stating â€œnull is not LEADER of null. Known leader is: N/A". This message now reads "Lock[<lock-name>] is no longer valid in the CP group [<group-id>] as the cluster has no information about Lock[<lock-name>]. Please recreate the lock or rejoin the cluster to obtain a valid reference."

For more details on new features, see xref:ROOT:whats-new.adoc[What's new in 5.5].

== Security
* **Security Fix for CVE-2023-45676**: We have resolved https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gcg6-xv4f-f749[CVE-2023-45676], a dependency vulnerability related to improper authorization checks in certain scenarios. This issue could potentially allow attackers to bypass expected permission restrictions.

== Fixes
* **Fixed task config publishing in Kafka Connect**: Fixed an issue in `LateJoiningListener` where a race condition in `ringbuffer.tailSequence()` could result in a missed message if a message was published between two calls to `tailSequence()`. Also resolved a race condition where a message could be processed before `sourceConnector` and `taskRunner` were fully initialized, causing a hidden NullPointerException (NPE). The listener is now registered only after these fields are set and additional logging is added for exceptions in `processMessage` to help identify issues like the hidden NPE.
* **Fixed migration issues with UCN classes in `InMemoryFormat.OBJECT`**: Fixed an issue where inserting an entry with classes from User Code Namespace (UCN) into an IMap and other data structures configured with `InMemoryFormat.OBJECT` resulted in migration failures.

== Known issues
* There is currently a known issue that has potential for causing a memory leak in Vector collections in some scenarios. For more information, including a workaround, see xref:data-structures:vector-collections.adoc#known-issue[Vector Collection Known Issue].
