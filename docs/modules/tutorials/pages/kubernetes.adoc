= Deploy Hazelcast using Kubernetes
:description: In this tutorial, you will deploy a Hazelcast cluster to Kubernetes and connect it to a Kubernetes application.

NOTE: Hazelcast now offers the Hazelcast Platform Operator. We recommend using this operator when working with Hazelcast in Kubernetes. For more info, see link:https://guides.hazelcast.org/kubernetes-external-client/[Connect External Hazelcast Client to Kubernetes].

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

{description}

== Before you Begin

* Up and running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster (version 1.9 or higher)
* Kubernetes command line tool, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl]
* (optional) https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm CLI]

== Deploy Hazelcast cluster

There are different ways of deploying Hazelcast to Kubernetes. For the production environment we recommend Hazelcast Platform Operator or Helm because these methods provide the complete Hazelcast experience, including the following aspects:

* Automated deployment including the Hazelcast Management Center tool
* Automated lifecycle operations (scaling, upgrades) to avoid data loss
* Role-based access control

Helm::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
helm install hz-hazelcast hazelcast/hazelcast
----
--

Hazelcast Platform Operator::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
helm install operator hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator --set installCRDs=true
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: hz-hazelcast
EOF
----
--

Kubectl::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/master/kubernetes-rbac.yaml

kubectl run hz-hazelcast-0 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-1 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-2 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"

kubectl create service clusterip hz-hazelcast --tcp=5701 -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl set selector --local -f - "role=hazelcast" -o yaml | kubectl create -f -
----

====

You can check that the Hazelcast cluster is up and running.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs hz-hazelcast-0
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.216.6.7]:5701 - 6d2100e0-8dcf-4e7c-ab40-8e98e23475e3 this
        Member [10.216.5.6]:5701 - 5ab4d554-fd7d-4929-8475-0ddf79a21076
        Member [10.216.8.6]:5701 - 7f7dd5f4-e732-4575-89d6-a6e823da38da
]
----

At this point you have started a Hazelcast cluster with 3 members. It is exposed with a service called `hz-hazelcast`.

== Configure Hazelcast client

Use Hazelcast client to connect to the running Hazelcast cluster from your applications.

To use Hazelcast client, add Hazelcast client dependency to your application.

    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>

NodeJS::

npm install hazelcast-client

Python::

[source, bash]
----
pip install hazelcast-python-client
----

{cpp}::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
curl -Lo hazelcast-cpp-client.tar.gz https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/archive/v${VERSION}.tar.gz

Go::
+

[source, bash]
----
go get github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-go-client@v1.0.0

====

Configure the Hazelcast client in your application to connect to the `hz-hazelcast` service.

Java::
+
--
[source, java]
----
ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
config.getNetworkConfig().addAddress("hz-hazelcast");
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, javascript]
----
const { Client } = require('hazelcast-client');

const clientConfig = {
    network: {
        clusterMembers: [
            'hz-hazelcast'
        ]
    }
};
const client = await Client.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
----

Python::
+
--
[source, python]
----
import hazelcast

client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
    cluster_members=["hz-hazelcast"],
)
----
--

{cpp}::
+

[source, cpp]
----
#include <hazelcast/client/hazelcast_client.h>

hazelcast::client::client_config config;
config.get_network_config()
      .add_address({"hz-hazelcast", 5701})
auto hz = hazelcast::new_client(std::move(config)).get();

[source, go]

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-go-client"
)

func main() {
	config := hazelcast.Config{}
	config.Cluster.Network.SetAddresses("hz-hazelcast:5701")
	ctx := context.Background()
	client, err := hazelcast.StartNewClientWithConfig(ctx, config)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}

Your application is now configured to automatically connect to the Hazelcast cluster once it's deployed to Kubernetes.

== Deploy client application

To deploy your application to Kubernetes cluster, you need first to dockerize it.

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client java
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client nodejs
----
--

Python::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client python
----
--

{cpp}::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client cpp
----
--

Go::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client go
----
--

====

[NOTE]
====
If you use a remote Kubernetes cluster and you want to build your own Docker image then make sure that you also push your Docker image into the Docker registry.
====

[source, bash]
----
kubectl run hazelcast-client --image=hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client
----

After a moment, check application logs to see it running in Kubernetes.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs hazelcast-client
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.216.6.7]:5701 - 6d2100e0-8dcf-4e7c-ab40-8e98e23475e3 this
        Member [10.216.5.6]:5701 - 5ab4d554-fd7d-4929-8475-0ddf79a21076
        Member [10.216.8.6]:5701 - 7f7dd5f4-e732-4575-89d6-a6e823da38da

----

To remove the client application, execute the following command.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete pod hazelcast-client
