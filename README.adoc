This repository contains the Antora components for the Hazelcast Platform documentation.

The documentation source files are marked up with AsciiDoc.

== Docs Structure

This section describes some important information about how this repository is structured:

- The component name, version, and start page are configured in each branch's `antora.yml` file.
- The navigation for all modules is stored in the ROOT module's `nav.adoc` file.
- The {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] instructs Antora to automatically build the site using content in the `main` branch as well as any branches that are prefixed with `v/`.

== Release Workflow

Documentation for new releases is hosted in versioned branches that are prefixed with `v/`. The `latest-dev` content (snapshot content) is stored in the `main` branch.

We support documentation for the latest patch releases of minor versions. For example, content for the `5.0` version is hosted in the `v/5.0` branch. This branch contains content for the latest patch release of version 5.0.

NOTE: The documentation build process is triggered whenever you create a new branch with the `v/` prefix, push to an existing `v/` branch, or push to the `main` branch.

=== Snapshot Releases

Add the new snapshot version to the following:

=== Patch Releases

In the `v/` branch for the minor version whose patch you are releasing, update the `asciidoc.attributes.full-version` field in the `antora.yml` file to the new patch version. For example, if you are releasing version 5.0.3, find the `v/5.0` branch and update the `asciidoc.attributes.full-version` field in the `antora.yml` file with 5.0.3.

NOTE: As soon as you push content to this branch, GitHub will trigger a new build of the site, which will include your new content.

=== Creating Release Branches

. If you are releasing a new major version, create a release branch from the `main` branch.
+
For example, if you are releasing version 5.1, create a new release branch named `5.1` from the `main` branch.

. Update the fields mentioned in <<latest-releases, Latest Releases>>.

. Remove the `prerelease: true` field from the docs/`antora.yml` file of the `hz-docs` repository.
+
IMPORTANT: If you are creating a branch for a beta release, do not remove this field.

. When you are ready to release, create a maintentance branch from the release branch.
+
NOTE: As soon as you push the maintenance branch to the repository, GitHub will trigger a new build of the site, which will include your new content.

. Make sure to delete the release branch.
+
For example, if you released version `5.1`, delete the `5.1` branch. This step helps to keep the repository clean of release branches.

== Generating PDFs

You can generate a PDF for each version of this documentation.

To generate PDFs, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- At least Ruby 2.7
- Node.js 16

To generate the PDFs, do the following in the root of this repository:

. Install the dependencies.
+
```bash
npm i
```

. Install Asciidoctor PDF.
+
```bash
bundle
```

. Execute the `create-pdfs.sh` script.

The result of this script is a `pdf-docs` directory, in which the artifacts for the PDF files are assembled and the PDF files are generated.

This script uses the link:https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-assembler/-/blob/main/README.adoc[Antora assembler extension].

== GitHub Actions

To automate some elements of the build process, this repository includes the following GitHub Actions:
