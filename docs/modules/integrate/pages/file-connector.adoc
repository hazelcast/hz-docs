= Unified File Connector
:description: The unified file connector provides a simple way to read files across different sources. Using this connector, you can read files from the local filesystem, HDFS and cloud storage systems such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage or Azure Blob Storage. This connector supports various data formats, including text files, CSV, JSON, and Avro.

{description}

NOTE: This connector can be used only as a source. To use files as a sink, you can use the Jet API with the xref:legacy-file-connector.adoc[legacy file connector]. You cannot yet use files as a sink in SQL.

== Installing the Connector

To read from a local or shared filesystem, you do not need to install any additional modules as these are included in the full and slim
distributions of Hazelcast.

To access Hadoop or any of the cloud-based file systems, you may need to add one of the downloadable modules listed in
<<supported-storage-systems, Supported Storage Systems>> to your members' classpaths.

Depending on the <<supported-file-formats, format of your files>>, you may also need to add other modules to the classpath.

== Permissions
[.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*

If xref:security:enable-security.adoc[security] is enabled, you can set up permissions to restrict clients' access to your files. For details, see xref:pipelines:job-security.adoc[].

== Supported File Systems

Hazelcast supports reading from the following file systems.

If you use the slim distribution of Hazelcast, be sure to add the respective modules to your members' classpaths.

|===

Although these are the officially supported sources, you can also read from
any file system that's compatible with Hadoop.

== Configuration Options

Use these options to configure the file connector.

=== `path`

The absolute path to a single directory.

This parameter must not contain any wildcard characters. The given directory is not read recursively.

Hazelcast supports the following path schemes:

* `hdfs`: HDFS
* `s3a`: Amazon S3
* `wasbs`: Azure Cloud Storage
* `adl`: Azure Data Lake Generation 1
* `abfs`: Azure Data Lake Generation 2
* `gs`: Google Cloud Storage

For example, a path to a file in a Hadoop cluster would start
with `hdfs://path/to/directory/`.

NOTE: Any path that does not start with a schema is considered local (files on Hazelcast members).

Default: 

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
-- 
The main entrypoint to the file connector is `FileSources.files`, which
takes a `path` as a `String` parameter and returns a `FileSourceBuilder` object.

If you don't specify a <<format, format>>, this API tries to read a `.txt` file line by line.

```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/path/to/my/directory")
  .build();
```
--
SQL:: 
+ 
--

Create a mapping to a directory, using the `path` option.

You must also specify a <<format, format>>.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'json-flat'
)
```
--
If you omit a column list from the `CREATE MAPPING` command:

- Hazelcast will read a sample file from the directory and try to determine column names and types from it.
- The `path` directory must be
available at the time you execute the `CREATE MAPPING` statement and it must not be empty.
- Every cluster member must have at least one file in the `path` directory. 

If you name the columns
explicitly, you can change the default type according to the xref:sql:data-types.adoc[conversion rules]. For example, the CSV format uses the `VARCHAR` type for all fields in the file. If you specify `INT` manually, the behavior would be as if `CAST(column
AS INT)` were used to convert `VARCHAR` to `INT`.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files (
  name VARCHAR,
  id INT
)
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'csv'
)
```
====

=== `format`

The file format.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
--
The file connector defaults to UTF-8 encoded text with the file
read line by line. You can specify the file format using
`format(FileFormat)` method.  See the available formats in the
`FileFormat.*` interface.

The Jet API supports all <<supported-file-formats, available file formats>>.
--
SQL:: 
+ 
--
You must provide a file format to create a mapping.

SQL file formats must be structured. As a result, SQL supports only the following file formats:

- <<avro, Avro>>
- <<csv, CSV>>
- <<json, JSON>>
- <<parquet, Parquet>>
--
====

=== `glob`

A filename pattern that uses wildcard characters such as `*` or
`?` to filter the files in the `path` directory.

Default: `*` (match all files)

For example, if a directory contains JSON files named using the
`YYYY-MM-DD.log` pattern, you can read all the files from January 2020 with the following `glob` argument:

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/orders/")
  .glob("2020-01-*.json")
  .build();
```
--
SQL:: 
+ 
-- 
```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_orders
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/orders',
    'format' = 'json-flat',
    'glob' = '2020-01-*.json'
)
```
--
====

=== `ignoreFileNotFound`

Return zero results instead of throwing an error when files in the `path` directory are not found.

Default: `false`

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/orders/")
  .glob("2020-01-*.json")
  .ignoreFileNotFound(true)
  .build();
```
--
SQL:: 
+ 
-- 
If you set this option to `true`, you must specify the column list.

This option is not valid for xref:sql:functions-and-operators.adoc#file-table-functions[file table functions], because they always need at least one
record from which to derive the column list.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_orders
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/orders',
    'format' = 'json-flat',
    'glob' = '2020-01-*.json'
    'ignoreFileNotFound' = 'true'
)
```
--
====


=== `option`

Options to pass to the file system such as <<authentication, authentication options>>.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/orders/")
  .glob("2020-01-*.json")
  .option("fs.s3a.impl.disable.cache", "true")
  .build();
```
--
SQL:: 
+ 
-- 
```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_orders
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/orders',
    'format' = 'json-flat',
    'glob' = '2020-01-*.json'
    'fs.s3a.impl.disable.cache' = 'true'
)
```
--
====

=== `sharedFileSystem`

Read shared files only once instead of reading each copy on every member.

Default: `false`

If the `path` directory is shared among cluster
members such as on a network mounted filesystem, set the
`sharedFileSystem` option to `true`. The files will be assigned among
the members and reading the files multiple times (once on each member)
will be avoided.

=== `useHadoopforLocalFiles`

Use the Hadoop connector module to read files from a
local filesystem.

Default: `false`

This option might be beneficial when you need to parallelize
reading from a single large file, or read only a subset of columns when
using the <<parquet, Parquet format>>. The `hazelcast-jet-hadoop` module
must be on your members' classpaths.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("wikipedia.txt")
  .useHadoopForLocalFiles(true)
  .build();
```

You can provide additional <<option, options>> to Hadoop. For example, to read all files in a directory recursively:

```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("wikipedia.txt")
  .useHadoopForLocalFiles(true)
  .option("mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.input.dir.recursive", "true")
  .build();
```
--
SQL:: 
+ 
-- 
This option is not supported by SQL.
--

====

== Supported File Formats

Hazelcast supports reading from the following file formats.

=== Avro

The Avro format allows you to read data from files in the Avro Object Container File
format. To use the Avro format you must have the
`hazelcast-jet-avro` module on your members' classpaths.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
--
Suppose you have a class `User`, generated from the Avro schema, you can
read the data from an Avro file in the following way. Notice that you
don't need to provide the `User` class to the builder, but you do need to
satisfy the Java type system:

```java
BatchSource<User> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("users.avro")
  .format(FileFormat.<User>avro())
  .build();
```

This example will use Avro's `SpecificDatumReader` under the hood.

If you don't have a class generated from the Avro schema, but the
structure of your class matches the data, you can use Java reflection to
read the data:

```java
BatchSource<User> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("users.avro")
  .format(FileFormat.avro(User.class))
  .build();
```

This example will use Avro's `ReflectDatumReader` under the hood.
--
SQL:: 
+ 
--
```sql
CREATE MAPPING users
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/users',
    'format' = 'avro',
    'glob' = '*.avro'
)
```

|===
--
====

=== CSV

CSV files must have a header. Columns that do not match any
fields are ignored, and fields that do not having corresponding columns have `null` values.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
--
The header columns must match
the class fields that you want to deserialize them into.

Create the file source in the following way to read from file
`users.csv` and deserialize into a `User` class.

```java
BatchSource<User> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("users.csv")
  .format(FileFormat.csv(User.class))
  .build();
```
--
SQL:: 
+ 
--
If you omit the column
list from the mapping declaration, Hazelcast will try to infer the column
names from the file header. All columns have the `VARCHAR` type.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'csv'
)
```
--
====

=== JSON

JSON files must be in the link:https://jsonlines.org/[JSON Lines] format.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
--
JSON
fields must match the class fields that you want to deserialize them into.

Create the file source in the following way to read from file
`users.jsonl` and deserialize into a `User` class.

```java
BatchSource<User> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("users.jsonl")
  .format(FileFormat.json(User.class))
  .build();
```
--
SQL:: 
+ 
--
JSON files are expected to contain one valid JSON document per
line and be `UTF-8` encoded. If you omit any mapping columns from the
declaration, Hazelcast infers names and types based on a sample.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'json-flat'
)
```

=== Text

Read data from .`txt` files.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
--
Create the file source in the following way to read file as text, whole
file is read as a single String:

```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("file.txt")
  .format(FileFormat.text())
  .build();
```

When reading from local filesystem you can specify the character
encoding. This is not supported when using the Hadoop based modules. If provided
the option will be ignored.

```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("file.txt")
  .format(FileFormat.text(Charset.forName("Cp1250")));
```

You can read file line by line in the following way, this is the default
and you can omit the `.format(FileFormat.lines())` part.

```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("file.txt")
  .format(FileFormat.lines())
  .build();
```
--
SQL:: 
+ 
--
This file format is not supported by SQL.
--
====

=== Parquet

Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format. It describes how the data
is stored on disk. It doesn't specify how the data is supposed to be
deserialized, and it uses other libraries to achieve that. Namely we use
Apache Avro for deserialization.

Parquet has a dependency on Hadoop, so it can be used only with one of
the Hadoop based modules.

[tabs]
==== 
Jet:: 
+ 
--
Create the file source in the following way to read data from a parquet
file:

```java
BatchSource<String> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("users.parquet")
  .format(FileFormat.<SpecificUser>parquet())
  .build();
```

To read parquet file from the local
filesystem, use the <<useHadoopForLocalFiles, `useHadoopForLocalFiles` option>>.
--
SQL:: 
+ 
--
```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = 'hdfs://path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'parquet'

)
```
--
====

=== Raw Binary

Read binary files such as images.

[tabs]
====
Jet:: 
+ 
--
```java
BatchSource<byte[]> source = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("file.txt")
  .format(FileFormat.bytes())

```
--
SQL:: 
+ 
--
This file format is not supported by SQL.
--
====


=== Fvecs and ivecs
[.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*

Fvecs and ivecs files are binary files containing, respectively, float and integer vectors with IDs.

[tabs]
====
Jet::
+
--
```java
BatchSource<Map.Entry<Integer, VectorValues>> vectors = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("embeddings.fvecs")
  .format(VectorSources.fvecsFormat())
  .build();

BatchSource<Map.Entry<Integer, int[]>> groundTruth = FileSources.files("/data")
  .glob("groundtruth.ivecs")
  .format(VectorSources.ivecsFormat())
  .build();
```
--
SQL::
+
--
This file format is not supported by SQL.
--
====


== Authentication

To allow Hazelcast to access files in remote systems, you must pass authentication credentials to the file connector.

Due to performance, authentication credentials are cached, which may cause issues
when xref:pipelines:submitting-jobs.adoc[submitting jobs] with different credentials, or even the
same jobs with new credentials such as after credentials rotation.

To turn off authentication caching, set the
`fs.<prefix>.impl.disable.cache` option to `true`, where `<prefix>` is a <<path, path schema>>.

=== Amazon S3

Provide your AWS access key ID and secret key with required access via
`fs.s3a.access.key` and `fs.s3a.secret.key` options.

For additional ways to authenticate see the
link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html#Authenticating_with_S3[Hadoop-AWS documentation]
and
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/credentials.html[Amazon S3 documentation]
.

=== Google Cloud Storage

Provide a location of the keyfile via
`google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile` source option.

NOTE: The file must be available on all the cluster members.

For additional ways to authenticate see
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/master/gcs/CONFIGURATION.md#authentication[Google Cloud Hadoop connector].

=== Windows Azure Blob Storage

Provide an account key via
`fs.azure.account.key.<your account name>.blob.core.windows.net` source
option.

For additional ways to authenticate see
link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure/index.html[Hadoop Azure Blob Storage]
support.

=== Azure Data Lake Generation 1

Provide the following options:

```text
fs.adl.oauth2.access.token.provider.type
fs.adl.oauth2.refresh.url
fs.adl.oauth2.client.id
fs.adl.oauth2.credential
```

For additional ways to authenticate see
link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure-datalake/index.html[Hadoop Azure Data Lake Support]

=== Azure Data Lake Generation 2

For additional ways to authenticate see
link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure/abfs.html[Hadoop Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2]

== Hadoop with Custom Classpath

When submitting jobs that use Hadoop, sending Hadoop JARs should be
avoided and instead the Hadoop classpath should be used. Hadoop JARs
contain some JVM hooks and can keep lingering references inside the JVM
long after the job has ended, causing memory leaks.

To obtain the Hadoop classpath, use the `hadoop classpath` command and
append the output to the `CLASSPATH` environment variable before
starting Hazelcast.

```bash
export CLASSPATH=$($HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop classpath)
```

== Hadoop Native Libraries

The underlying Hadoop infrastructure can make a use of native libraries
for compression/decompression and CRC checksums. When the native
libraries are not configured you will see the following message in the logs:

```
[o.a.h.u.NativeCodeLoader]: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable
```

Configure the native libraries by adding the location to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to hadoop>/lib/native:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

To verify that the Hadoop native libraries were successfully configured,
you should no longer see the message above and if you enable logging
for `org.apache.hadoop` you should see the following log message:

```
[o.a.h.u.NativeCodeLoader]: Loaded the native-hadoop library
```

For more detail please see the link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/NativeLibraries.html[Hadoop Native Libraries Guide]
