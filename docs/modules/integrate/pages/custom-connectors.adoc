= Custom Connectors

If Hazelcast doesn't natively support the data source/sink you need, you can
build a connector for it yourself by using the
link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/pipeline/SourceBuilder.html[SourceBuilder]
and
link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/pipeline/SinkBuilder.html[SinkBuilder].

== SourceBuilder

To make a custom source connector you need two basic ingredients:

* a _context_ object that holds all the resources and state you need to keep track of
* a stateless function, _`fillBufferFn`_, taking two parameters: the state object and a buffer object provided by the Jet API

Hazelcast repeatedly calls `fillBufferFn` whenever it needs more data items.
Optimally, the function will fill the buffer with the items it can
acquire without blocking. A hundred items at a time is enough to
eliminate any per-call overheads within Hazelcast. The function is allowed to
block as well, but taking longer than a second to complete can have
negative effects on the overall performance of the processing pipeline.

In the following examples we build a simple batch source that emits
the lines of a file:

```java
BatchSource<String> fileSource = SourceBuilder
    .batch("file-source", x -> new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt")))
    .<String>fillBufferFn((in, buf) -> {
        String line = in.readLine();
        if (line != null) {
            buf.add(line);
        } else {
            buf.close();
        }
    })
    .destroyFn(BufferedReader::close)
    .build();
```

For a more involved example (which reads data in _batches_ for
efficiency, deals with _unbounded_ data, emits _timestamps_, is
_distributed_ and _fault tolerant_ see the
xref:pipelines:custom-batch-source.adoc[Custom Batch Sources] and
xref:pipelines:custom-stream-source.adoc[Custom Stream Sources] tutorials).

== SinkBuilder

To make your custom sink connector you need two basic ingredients:

* a _context_ object that holds all the resources and state you need to keep track of
* a stateless function, _`receiveFn`_, taking two parameters: the state object and a data item sent to the sink

In the following example we build a simple sink which writes the
`toString()` form of objects to a file:

```java
Sink<Object> sink = sinkBuilder(
    "file-sink", x -> new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt")))
    .receiveFn((out, item) -> out.println(item.toString()))
    .destroyFn(PrintWriter::close)
    .build();
```

For a more involved example, covering issues like _batching_,
_distributiveness_ and _fault tolerance_, see the
xref:pipelines:custom-sink.adoc[Custom Sinks] tutorial).
