= Upgrading from Jet
:description: This guide covers the most important changes that affect users of Jet 4.x who want to upgrade to Hazelcast.

{description}

This guide is not an overview of the new features in Hazelcast Platform. This release includes other enhancements that don't need any special attention during an upgrade.

== Before you Upgrade

If you're using Jet Enterprise version 4.x, you can run your existing jobs on an upgraded cluster. Just cancel any running jobs on your Jet cluster before upgrading. Then, resubmit the job to the upgraded cluster.

WARNING: You will lose the state of any running jobs that have not yet completed.

For help canceling jobs, see xref:pipelines:job-management.adoc[].

See xref:pipelines:submitting-jobs.adoc[].

== Compatibility

Hazelcast Platform is compatible only with the Job and Pipeline APIs of Jet 4.x. As a result, you can resubmit jobs that were running on Jet 4.x clusters to a {full-version} cluster. But, you *cannot* do the following:

- Upgrade to {full-version} using rolling upgrades.
- Connect to a {full-version} cluster using version 4.x of clients.
- Resubmit jobs from snapshots that were made on Jet 4.x clusters.
- Use versions of Management Center before {full-version}.

== Jet Engine Security

In embedded mode (Hazelcast in the same JVM as your application), you cannot use Jet APIs or SQL by default. These features are disabled for security reasons. For more information about security in the Jet engine and how to enable/disable the Jet engine, see xref:pipelines:job-security.adoc[].

== Configuration

By default, Hazelcast Platform looks for configurations in the following order and applies only the first one that it finds:

. A `Config` object

. A YAML or XML file whose path is given in the `hazelcast.config` system property

. A `hazelcast.xml` file in the working directory

. A `hazelcast.xml` file on the classpath

. A `hazelcast.yaml` file in the working directory

. A `hazelcast.yaml` file on the classpath

NOTE: You can also override these configurations, using system properties or environment variables. See xref:configuration:overriding-configuration-settings.adoc[].

Jet 4.x did not offer an option to configure it using XML. As a result, you must do one of the following:

- Add your configurations to the `Config` object.
+
Some of the `JetConfig` API has been moved to the `Config` object. See <<imdg-configuration, IMDG Configuration>>, <<instanceconfig,InstanceConfig>>, and <<configuration-loaders, Configuration Loaders>>, and <<jet-properties, Jet Properties>> on this page.
- Pass the path of your YAML file to the `hazelcast.config` system property.
+
For the Jet engine related configuration fields, see the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-full-example.yaml#L3490[example YAML file].
NOTE: If your YAML file is invalid, the member will not start. Hazelcast Platform checks and validates your YAML configurations during a cluster startup. See <<yaml-file-validation, YAML File Validation>> on this page.
- Add your configurations to the `hazelcast.xml` file.
+
For the Jet engine related configuration elements, see the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-full-example.yaml#L3490[example XML file] on GitHub.

=== IMDG Configuration

The following methods for configuring the underlying IMDG instance of Jet have been removed from the `JetConfig` object:

- `getHazelcastConfig()`
- `configureHazelcast()`
- `setHazelcastConfig()`

If you used the `JetConfig` object to configure IMDG, you should replace instances of `JetConfig` with link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/Config.html[`Config`].

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet 4.x:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
JetConfig config = new JetConfig().configureHazelcast(c -> {
  c.getNetworkConfig().setPort(8000);
  c.setClusterName("jet-dev");
  });

JetInstance jet = Jet.newJetInstance(config);
```
--
Hazelcast:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
Config config = new Config() ;
config.setPort(8000);
config.setClusterName("jet-dev");

HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
```
--
====

=== InstanceConfig

The `InstanceConfig` object has been deprecated and all its methods have been added to the `JetConfig` object.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet 4.x:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
JetConfig jetConfig = new JetConfig();
jetConfig.getInstanceConfig().setCooperativeThreadCount(4);
```
--
Hazelcast:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
Config config = new Config();
config.getJetConfig().setCooperativeThreadCount(4);
```
--
====

=== Configuration Loaders

All configuration loader methods have been moved from the `JetConfig` object to the `Config` (Hazelcast configuration) object. Some of these methods have been renamed. If you used Jet configuration loaders, use the following table to find out what you should replace in your code:

[cols="1m,1a"]
|===
|Jet method |Hazelcast method

|JetConfig.loadDefault()
|`Config.loadDefault()` or `Config.load()`

|JetConfig.loadFromClasspath()
|`Config.loadFromClasspath()`

|JetConfig.loadFromFile()
|`Config.loadFromFile()`

|JetConfig.loadXmlFromStream()
|`Config.loadFromStream()`

|JetConfig.loadXmlFromString()
|`Config.loadFromString()`

|JetConfig.loadYamlFromStream()
|`Config.loadFromStream()`

|JetConfig.loadYamlFromString()
|`Config.loadFromString()`

|===

=== Jet Properties

In the Java API, properties in the `JetProperties` object have been merged into the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/spi/properties/ClusterProperty.html[`ClusterProperty` object].

The following Jet properties have been removed:

- `jet.home`
- `jet.imdg.version.mismatch.check.disabled`

All Jet system properties are now prefixed with `hazelcast`. For example `jet.job.scan.period` is now `hazelcast.jet.job.scan.period`. Any Jet system properties that do not include this prefix have been deprecated.

If you use the Java API to set system properties, you must now use the `Config` object instead of the `JetConfig` object.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet 4.x:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
JetConfig config = new JetConfig() ;
config.setProperty( "hazelcast.property.foo", "value" );
```
--
Hazelcast:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
Config config = new Config() ;
config.setProperty( "hazelcast.property.foo", "value" );
```
--
====

See xref:configuration:configuring-with-system-properties.adoc[].

=== YAML File Validation

Hazelcast Platform checks and validates your YAML configurations during a cluster startup.
According to this validation:

- The top-level `hazelcast` object must exist. 
- Client and member YAML configurations must be separate (not in the same file).
- There must be no case-insensitive enum values.

While upgrading to Hazelcast Platform, if a YAML configuration violates any of these rules,
the cluster will not start. You need to either edit and update your YAML configuration files or disable the validation by setting the `hazelcast.config.schema.validation.enabled` property to `false`.

== API Entry Points

The `Jet` class, which was the main entry point of Jet 4.x,
has been deprecated and replaced by the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/HazelcastInstance.html[`HazelcastInstance` class].

The `JetInstance` class, which
represented an instance of a Jet member or client has been deprecated and replaced by the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/JetService.html[`JetService` class]. To access Jet related services, you should now use the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/HazelcastInstance.html#getJet--[`HazelcastInstance.getJet()` method] to get an instance of the `JetService` object.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet 4.x:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
JetInstance jet = Jet.newJetInstance();
```
--
Hazelcast:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
JetService jet = hz.getJet();
```
--
====

Use the following table to find out which new class to use instead of JetInstance`.

.JetInstance Replacements
[cols="1a,1m"]
|===
|Usage|New class

| Submitting streaming/batch jobs to the cluster and managing them.
|JetService

|Accessing Hazelcast data structures.
a|`HazelcastInstance`

The only exception is Jet observables. An observable is a Jet data structure that is part of the `JetService` class. 

|Performing cluster operations such as shutting down the cluster.
|HazelcastInstance
|===

The `JetInstance.bootstrappedInstance()` method has also been deprecated and replaced by `HazelcastInstance.bootstrappedInstance()`.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet 4.x:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
JetInstance jet = Jet.bootstrappedInstance();
```
--
Hazelcast:: 
+ 
-- 
```java
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.bootstrappedInstance();
JetService jet = hz.getJet();
```

====

== Lossless Cluster Restart

The `hot-restart-persistence` configuration has been renamed to `persistence`. If you use lossless cluster restart, you must update your configuration with this change.

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <persistence enabled="true">
    <base-dir>/mnt/persistence</base-dir>
    <backup-dir>/mnt/hot-backup</backup-dir>
  </persistence>
  <jet>
    <instance>
      <lossless-restart-enabled>true</lossless-restart-enabled>
    </instance>
  </jet>
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    base-dir: /mnt/persistence
    backup-dir: /mnt/hot-backup
  jet:
    instance:
      lossless-restart-enabled: true
----
--
====

Persistence files are now saved to the directory that's set in the xref:storage:configuring-persistence.adoc#persistence-base-dir[`persistence.base-dir` field]. In Jet 4.x, these files were saved to the directory that was set in the `jet.home` property. However, this property has been removed. See the <<jet-properties, changes to Jet properties>> on this page.

See xref:storage:configuring-persistence.adoc[].

== SQL

The slim distribution of Hazelcast Platform does not include the SQL module. If you use the slim distribution with SQL, link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.hazelcast/hazelcast-sql[download the `hazelcast-sql` module]. For a complete list of contents in each distribution of Hazelcast Platform, see xref:getting-started:install-hazelcast.adoc#full-and-slim-packages[Full and Slim Packages].

In the `information_schema.mappings` table, the following column names have been changed to make them consistent with the ANSI SQL standard. If you queried this table in Jet, make sure to use the correct column names in Hazelcast Platform.

.Changes to column names in the information_schema.mapping tables
[cols="1m,1m"]
|===
|Column name in Jet|Column name in Hazelcast Platform

|mapping_catalog
|table_catalog

|mapping_schema
|table_schema

|mapping_name
|table_name

|===

The JSON serialization format has been renamed to `json-flat`, and the `JSON_FILE()` table function has been renamed to `JSON_FLAT_FILE`. If you queried JSON with SQL in Jet, make sure to replace `json` with `json-flat`.

[tabs] 
==== 
Jet 4.x:: 
+ 
-- 
```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'json'
)
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE(
  JSON_FILE(path => '/path/to/directory')
);
```

== Code Samples

Jet code samples have been moved to the Hazelcast code samples repository. See link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/jet[GitHub].

== Scripts

Most scripts in the `bin` directory have been renamed. If you have any automated processes that use these scripts, update them to use the new scripts.
