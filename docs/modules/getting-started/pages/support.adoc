If your organization subscribes to Hazelcast support,
and you already have an account setup, you can login to your account and open
a support request using our ticketing system:  https://support.hazelcast.com/s/?utm_source=docs-website[Hazelcast Support Portal].

When submitting a ticket to the team, please provide as much information and data as possible:

This will allow the team to route the issue to the proper expert

* `DEV` issues are considered as severity 3 and priority low.
* All other issues, e.g., questions or documentation review are considered as severity 3 or higher.

=== Adding Details to the Support Ticket

* When you open a support ticket add a concise title and description of the problem.
* Add steps to reproduce as best as you can document them so that support can attempt
to reproduce the problem. This includes Detailed description of incident â€“ what happened and when. 
* Add a reproducible test case, this is optional - Hazelcast engineering may ask for it if required.
* Add details of use case. This is crucial as it helps support narrow down the features and
functionality in play when the problem occurred.
* Attach any specific errors found.
* Attach the complete logs files, i.e., Hazelcast logs.
* Attach Hazelcast process logs.
* Attach Hazelcast health monitor logs.
* Attach thread dumps from all members.

* When providing Hazelcast logs, please make sure that the system and
environment details that are captured at system startup are included, even if you truncate the logs.
* Add Hazelcast diagnostic logs. Please do not truncate diagnostics logs. They only capture Hazelcast
systems specific information and details.
* Please make sure that the logs capture data around the date and time of the incident.

Please consider the above for prompt help from the team and note that the more information
is provided upfront the better.
