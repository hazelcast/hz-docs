= DMT Command Reference

The DMT commands allow you to manage your migration. DMT extends CLC, and uses the same the configuration. For further information on the configuration. refer to the https://docs.hazelcast.com/clc/latest/configuration[Configuration for Hazelcast CLC,window=_blank] topic in the CLC documentation. DMT adds migration configuration, which is provided as a path to the migration config folder.

The DMT commands have the following format:

[source,bash]
----
dmt [command] [dmt-config-path] [flags]

[dmt-config-path] is the path of the "migration_config" folder that includes your migration config, which is explained in xref:migrate:data-migration-tool.adoc[Using the Data Migration Tool] section.
