= Error Handling Strategies for Jobs
:description: Jobs may not run as expected due to I/O errors in sources and sinks, or coding and input data errors in your pipelines. To handle these errors you can use one of the following strategies.

{description}

== Handling Errors in Sources and Sinks

Sources and sinks are often the points of contact with external data stores.
Their various types have specific characteristics which enable error
handling strategies only applicable to them.

For example, the xref:integrate:cdc-connectors.adoc[Change Data Capture sources] can attempt to reconnect
automatically whenever they lose connection to the databases they
monitor, so for intermittent network failures, their owner jobs don't
need to fail.

To see the failure handling options of a given source or sink, consult its Javadoc.

For in-memory data structures, a large portion of error handling, such as
communications failures with the remote cluster, is
handled by the Hazelcast cluster. For
further details and configuration options, see xref:clients:java.adoc#handling-failures[Handling Failures].

== Handling Errors in Pipelines

The primary way of dealing with errors in pipelines is to
make all jobs independent of each other. In a cluster,
there is an arbitrary number of independent jobs running in parallel.
Hazelcast ensures that these jobs do not interact in any way, and one's
failure does not lead to any consequences for the others.

The concern of error handling becomes: what happens to a job once it
encounters a problem. By default, Hazelcast fails a job that has thrown an
error, but what one can do with such a failed job afterward is the
interesting part.

=== Jobs Without Mutable State

For many streaming jobs, specifically the ones which don't have any
processing guarantee configured, the pipeline definition and the job
config are the only parts we can identify as state, and those are
immutable.

One option for dealing with failure in immutable-state jobs is simply
restarting them (once the cause of the failure has been addressed).
Restarted streaming jobs lacking mutable state can just resume
processing the input data flow from the current point in time.

Batch jobs don't strictly fall into this immutable-state category, but
the generic, reliable way of dealing with their error in Hazelcast
is also restarting them from the beginning and having them completely
reprocess their input.

=== Processing Guarantees

Streaming jobs with mutable state, those with a xref:fault-tolerance:fault-tolerance.adoc#processing-guarantee-is-a-shared-concern[processing guarantee]
set, achieve fault tolerance by periodically saving xref:fault-tolerance:fault-tolerance.adoc#distributed-snapshot[recovery snapshots]. If a streaming job was allowed to fail, the snapshots would be deleted. For this reason, by default all streaming jobs are suspended on failure, instead of failing completely. For more details, see link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/config/JobConfig.html#setSuspendOnFailure(boolean)[`JobConfig.setSuspendOnFailure`]
and
link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/Job.html#getSuspensionCause()[`Job.getSuspensionCause`].

NOTE: If you use the xref:sql:create-job.adoc#using-a-jobstatuslistener[CREATE JOB statement] to submit a job to your Hazelcast cluster, the job is automatically set to suspend on failure. 

A job in the suspended state has its snapshot preserved, and you can
resume it without data loss once you have addressed the root cause of the
failure.

In the open-source version of Hazelcast, this scenario is limited to fixing the
input data by some external means and then simply xref:pipelines:job-management.adoc#restarting[resuming the job].

The Enterprise version of Hazelcast has the added option of xref:pipelines:job-update[job upgrades]. In that case you can:

* export the latest snapshot
* update the pipeline, if needed, for example, to cope with unexpected
  data
* resubmit a new job based on the exported snapshot and the updated
  pipeline

One caveat of the suspend-on-failure feature is that the latest snapshot
is not a "failure snapshot". Hazelcast can't take a full snapshot right at the
moment of the failure, because the Jet engine can produce accurate
snapshots only when in a healthy state. Instead, Hazelcast simply keeps the
latest periodic snapshot it created. Even so, the recovery procedure
preserves the at-least-once guarantee.
