= Integrating OpenSSL / BoringSSL
:page-enterprise: true

TLS in Java is normally provided by the Java runtime (JRE). However, the performance overhead can be
significant; even with AES intrinsics enabled. If you are using an x86_64 system (Linux, Mac, Windows), Hazelcast supports native
integration for TLS which can provide significant performance
improvements. There are two supported native TLS libraries available through
https://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html[netty-tcnative^] libraries:

* OpenSSL
** dynamically linked
** prerequisites: `libapr`, `openssl` packages installed on your system
* BoringSSL - Google managed fork of the OpenSSL
** statically linked
** easier to get started with
** benefits: reduced code footprint, additional features

The native TLS integration can be used on clients and/or members. For best performance, it
is recommended to install on a client and member and
configure the appropriate cipher suite(s).

Check the https://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html[netty-tcnative^] page
for installation details.

== Netty Libraries

For native TLS integration in Java, the https://netty.io/[Netty^] library is used.

Make sure the following libraries from the Netty framework and their dependencies are on the classpath:

* `netty-handler`
* one of `tc-native` implementations
** either BoringSSL: `netty-tcnative-boringssl-static`
** or OpenSSL: `netty-tcnative` (for given OS architecture)

NOTE: The `netty-handler` and `tcnative` artifacts have different versioning strategies.
It is important that the these versions are compatible. The safe way
is to download the `netty-<version>.tar.bz2` file
from the https://netty.io/downloads.html[Netty^] website and check which
`netty-tcnative` version is used for that Netty release. Other possibility
is to use import `netty-bom` in Maven for dependency management.

== Using BoringSSL

The statically linked BoringSSL binaries are included within the `netty-tcnative`
libraries. There is no need to install additional software on supported systems.

== Using OpenSSL

. Install OpenSSL. Make sure that you are installing 1.0.1 or newer release.
See its documentation at
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md[github.com/openssl^].
. Install Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. See https://apr.apache.org/download.cgi[apr.apache.org^].
+
For RHEL: `sudo yum -y install apr openssl`
+
For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get -y install libapr1 openssl`
+
For Alpine Linux: `apk add --update apr openssl`

== Configuring Hazelcast for OpenSSL

Configuring OpenSSL in Hazelcast is straight forward. On the client and/or
member side, the following snippet enables TLS
using OpenSSL:

            <properties>

hazelcast:
  network:
    ssl:
      enabled: true
      factory-class-name: com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.OpenSSLEngineFactory
      properties:
        protocol: TLSv1.2
        trustCertCollectionFile: trusted-certs.pem

        # If the TLS mutual authentication is not used, following lines (key configuration) are not needed on the client side.
        keyFile: privkey.pem
        keyCertChainFile: chain.pem
----

The configuration is similar to a regular TLS integration. The main differences
are the `OpenSSLEngineFactory` factory class and the following properties:

* `keyFile`: Path of your PKCS#8 key file in PEM format.
* `keyPassword`: Password to access the key file when it's encrypted.
* `keyCertChainFile`: Path to an X.509 certificate chain file in PEM format.
* `trustCertCollectionFile`: Path to an X.509 certificate collection file in PEM format.
* `fipsMode`: Boolean flag to switch OpenSSL into the FIPS mode. See the xref:security:fips-140-2.adoc[FIPS 140-2 section].

The key and certificate related properties take precedence over keyStore and
trustStore configurations.
Using keyStores and trustStores together with OpenSSL causes problems on some
Java versions, therefore we recommend to use the OpenSSL native way.

The following are the other supported properties:

* `keyStore`: Path of your keystore file.
** _Using the `keyStore` property is not recommended, use `keyFile` and
`keyCertChainFile` instead_
* `keyStorePassword`: Password to access the key from your keystore file.
* `keyStoreType`: Type of the keystore. Its default value is `JKS`. Another
commonly used type is the `PKCS12`. Available keystore/truststore types depend
on your Operating system and the Java runtime.
* `keyManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the authentication
keys are provided.
* `trustManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the trust managers
are provided.
* `trustStore`: Path of your truststore file. The file truststore is a keystore file
that contains a collection of certificates
 trusted by your application. Its type should be `JKS`.
 ** _Using the `trustStore` property is not recommended, use `trustCertCollectionFile` instead_
* `trustStorePassword`: Password to unlock the truststore file.
* `trustStoreType`: Type of the truststore. Its default value is `JKS`. Another
commonly used type is the `PKCS12`. Available keystore/truststore types depend on
your operating system and the Java runtime.
* `mutualAuthentication`: Mutual authentication configuration. It's empty
by default which means the client side of connection is not authenticated.
Available values are:
** `REQUIRED` - server forces usage of a trusted client certificate
** `OPTIONAL` - server asks for a client certificate, but it doesn't
require it
* `ciphersuites`: Comma-separated list of cipher suite names allowed to be used.
* `protocol`: Name of the algorithm which is used in your TLS. Its default
value is empty, meaning the protocol version to use is not specified. Available
values depend on the engine implementation but usually support:
** `TLS` (equivalent to the empty value)
** `TLSv1.2`
** `TLSv1.3`
+
For the
`protocol` property, we recommend you to provide TLS with its version
information, e.g., `TLSv1.3`. It ensures the engine won't allow a fallback to an old, insecure version.

* `validateIdentity`: Flag which allows enabling endpoint identity validation. It means, during the TLS handshake client verifies if the server's hostname (or IP address) matches the information in X.509 certificate (Subject Alternative Name extension). Possible values are `"true"` and `"false"` (default).
