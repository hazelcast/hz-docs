= Split-Brain Recovery

Hazelcast deploys a background task that periodically searches for split clusters.
When a split is detected, the side that will initiate the merge process is decided.
This decision is based on the cluster size; the smaller cluster, by
member count, merges into the bigger one. If they have an equal number of members,
then a hashing algorithm determines the merging cluster. When deciding the merging side,
both sides ensure that there's no overlap in their member lists. In some cases, recovery from
split-brain may be problematic due to discovery issues; see <<eliminating-unsuccessful-cluster-merges, Eliminating Unsuccessful Cluster Merges>> on how to overcome these issues.

After the merging side is decided, the oldest cluster member of
the merging side initiates the cluster merge process by sending
merge instructions to the members in its cluster.

[NOTE]
====
* The oldest cluster member (master) runs the split-brain check for every xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc#splitbrain-check-interval[hazelcast.merge.next.run.delay.seconds]. First check is done xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc#splitbrain-first-check [hazelcast.merge.first.run.delay.seconds] seconds after the startup.
* Master member checks the IP addresses in the member list, and tries consecutive ports. The count to try is defined by xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc#tcp-try-count[hazelcast.tcp.join.port.try.count].
* Only the master member searches for other clusters for possible split-brain situations.
* The split-brain recovery process initiates when the master member of smaller cluster detects that of the larger cluster.
However, if the master of larger cluster communicates with that of the smaller cluster, and not the other way around, the recovery process cannot commence.
====

While recovering from partitioning, Hazelcast uses merge policies for
supported data structures to resolve data conflicts between split clusters.
A merge policy is a callback function to resolve conflicts between
the existing and merging data. Hazelcast provides an interface to be
implemented and also a selection of out-of-the-box policies.
Data structures without split-brain recovery support discarding the data from merging side.

Each member of the merging cluster:

* closes all its network connections (detach from its cluster)
* takes a snapshot of local data structures which support split-brain recovery
* discards all data structure data
* joins to the new cluster as lite member
* sends merge operations to the new cluster from local snapshots.

For more information, see the xref:consistency-and-replication:consistency.adoc[Consistency and Replication Model chapter].

== Merge Policies

All merge policies implement the unified interface `com.hazelcast.spi.SplitBrainMergePolicy`.
We provide the following out-of-the-box implementations:

* `DiscardMergePolicy`: The entry from the smaller cluster is discarded.
* `ExpirationTimeMergePolicy`: The entry with the higher expiration time wins.
* `HigherHitsMergePolicy`: The entry with the higher number of hits wins.
* `HyperLogLogMergePolicy`: Specialized merge policy for the `CardinalityEstimator`,
which uses the default merge algorithm from HyperLogLog research, keeping
the maximum register value of the two given instances.
* `LatestAccessMergePolicy`: The entry with the latest access wins.
* `LatestUpdateMergePolicy`: The entry with the latest update wins.
* `PassThroughMergePolicy`: the entry from the smaller cluster wins.
* `PutIfAbsentMergePolicy`: The entry from the smaller cluster wins if
it doesn't exist in the cluster.

Additionally, you can develop a custom merge policy by implementing
the `SplitBrainMergePolicy` interface, as explained in the
<<custom-merge-policies, Custom Merge Policies section>>

== Supported Data Structures

The following data structures support split-brain recovery:

* `IMap` (including High-Density Memory Store backed IMap)
* `ICache` (including High-Density Memory Store backed IMap)
* `ReplicatedMap`
* `MultiMap`
* `IAtomicLong`
* `IAtomicReference`
* `IQueue`
* `IList`
* `ISet`
* `Ringbuffer`
* `CardinalityEstimator`
* `ScheduledExecutorService`
* `VectorCollection` [.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*

The statistic based out-of-the-box merge policies are only supported by
`IMap`, `ICache`, `ReplicatedMap` and `MultiMap`.
The `HyperLogLogMergePolicy` is supported by the `CardinalityEstimator`.

IMPORTANT: Except the `CardinalityEstimator` data structure,
the default merge policy for all the Hazelcast data structures that
support split-brain recovery (listed above) is `PutIfAbsentMergePolicy`.
For the `CardinalityEstimator` data structure,
the default merge policy is `HyperLogLogMergePolicy`.

See also the <<merge-types, Merge Types section>> for a complete overview of
supported merge types of each data structure. There is a config validation which
checks these constraints to provide fail-fast behavior for invalid configurations.

NOTE: For the other data structures, e.g., `ISemaphore`, `ICountDownLatch` and `ILock`,
the instance from the smaller cluster is discarded during the split-brain recovery.

== Configuring Merge Policies

The merge policies are configured via a `MergePolicyConfig`, which can be set for
all supported data structures. The only exception is `ICache`, which just accepts
the merge policy classname (due to compatibility reasons with older Hazelcast clients).
For `ICache`, all other configurable merge parameters are the default values from `MergePolicyConfig`.

For custom merge policies you should set the full class name of your implementation as
the `merge-policy` configuration. For the out-of-the-box merge policies the simple classname is enough.

=== Declarative Configuration

Here are examples how merge policies can be specified for various data structures:

[source,java]

[#custom-merge-policies]
== Custom Merge Policies

To implement a custom merge policy you have to implement `com.hazelcast.spi.SplitBrainMergePolicy`:

[source,java]
----
public interface SplitBrainMergePolicy<V, T extends MergingValue<V>, R>
    extends DataSerializable {

  R merge(T mergingValue, T existingValue);
}
----

`MergingValue` is an interface which describes a merge type.

NOTE: Please have in mind that `existingValue` can be `null`.
This happens when a data structure or key-based entry was just created in the smaller cluster.

=== Merge Types

A merge type defines an attribute which is required by a merge policy and provided by a data structure.

`MergingValue` is the main merge type, which is required by all merge policies and provided by
all data structures. It contains the value of the merged data in raw (in-memory storage) and
deserialized format:

[source,java]
----
public interface MergingValue<V> extends MergingView {

  V getValue();

  Object getRawValue();
}
----

`MergingValue` extends `MergingView`, which is a marker interface extended by all provided merge types.

The most common extension of `MergingValue` is `MergingEntry`, which additionally provides the key in
raw (in-memory storage) and deserialized format (used by all key-based data structures like
`IMap` or `ICache`):

[source,java]
----
public interface MergingEntry<K, V> extends MergingValue<V> {

  K getKey();

  Object getRawKey();
}
----

In addition, we have a bunch of specialized merge types, e.g., for provided statistics.
An example is `MergingHits`, which provides the hit counter of the merge data:

[source,java]
----
public interface MergingHits extends MergingView {

  long getHits();
}
----

The class `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.SplitBrainMergeTypes` contains composed interfaces,
which show the provided merge types and required merge policy return type for each data structure:

[source,java]
----
public interface ReplicatedMapMergeTypes<K, V> extends MergingEntry<K, V>,
    MergingCreationTime, MergingHits, MergingLastAccessTime, MergingLastUpdateTime,
    MergingTTL {
}

public interface QueueMergeTypes<V> extends MergingValue<Collection<V>> {
}
----

The `ReplicatedMap` provides key/value merge data, with the creation time, access hits,
last access time, last update time and TTL. The return type of the merge policy is `Object`.

The `IQueue` just provides a collection of values. The return type is also a `Collection<Object>`.

The following is the full list of merge types:

* `MergingValue`: Represents the value of the merged data.
* `MergingEntry`: Represents the key and value of the merged data.
* `MergingCreationTime`: Represents the creation time of the merging process.
* `MergingHits`: Represents the access hits of the merged data.
* `MergingLastAccessTime`: Represents the last time when the merged data is accessed.
* `MergingLastUpdateTime`: Represents the last time when the merged data is updated.
* `MergingTTL`: Represents the time-to-live value of the merged data.
* `MergingMaxIdle`: Represents the maximum idle timeout value of the merged data.
* `MergingCost`: Represents the memory costs for the merging process after a split-brain.
* `MergingVersion`: Represents the version of the merged data.
* `MergingExpirationTime`: Represents the expiration time of the merged data.
* `MergingLastStoredTime`: Represents the last stored time of the merged data.

And the following table shows the merge types provided by each data structure:

The following sections show various examples on how to implement
merge type interfaces for all data structures, specific merge types or a specific data structure.

=== Accessing Deserialized Values

`MergingValue.getRawValue()` and `MergingEntry.getRawKey()` always return
the data in the in-memory format of the data structure.
For some data structure like `IMap` this depends on your configuration.
Other data structure like `ISet` or `IList` always use the `BINARY` in-memory format.

If you need the deserialized key or value, you have to call `MergingValue.getValue()` or
`MergingEntry.getKey()`.
The deserialization is done lazily on that method call, since it's quite expensive and
should be avoided if the result is not needed.
This also requires the deserialized classes to be on the classpath of the server.
Otherwise, a `ClassNotFoundException` is thrown.

This is an example which checks if the (deserialized) value of
the `mergingValue` or `existingValue` is an `Integer`.
If so it is merged, otherwise `null` is returned (which  removes the entry):


[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/networkpartitioning/MergeIntegerValuesMergePolicy.java[tag=mivmp]
----


For data structures like `ISet` or `ICollection` you need a merge policy, which supports collections:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/networkpartitioning/MergeCollectionOfIntegerValuesMergePolicy.java[tag=mc]
----


You can also combine both merge policies to support single values and collections.
This merge policy is a bit more complex and less type safe, but can be configured on all data structures:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/networkpartitioning/MergeIntegerValuesMergePolicy2.java[tag=mivmp2]
----


NOTE: Please have in mind that `existingValue` can be `null`, so a `null` check is
mandatory before calling `existingValue.getValue()` or `existingValue.getRawValue()`.

NOTE: If you return `null` on a collection based data structure, the whole data structure will be removed.
An empty collection works in the same way, so you don't have to check `Collection.isEmpty()` in your merge policy.

=== Accessing Hazelcast UserContext

If you need access to external references in your merge policy,
you can use the Hazelcast `UserContext` to get them injected.
An example would be a database connection to check which value is stored in your database.
To achieve this your merge policy needs to implement `HazelcastInstanceAware` and
call `HazelcastInstance.getUserContext()`:


[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/networkpartitioning/UserContextMergePolicy.java[tag=ucmp]
----

The `UserContext` can be setup like this:

[source,java]
----
MergePolicyConfig mergePolicyConfig = new MergePolicyConfig()
  .setPolicy(UserContextMergePolicy.class.getName());

MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig("default")
  .setMergePolicyConfig(mergePolicyConfig);

ConcurrentMap<String, Object> userContext = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, Object>();
userContext.put(TruthProvider.TRUTH_PROVIDER_ID, new ExampleTruthProvider());

Config config = new Config()
  .addMapConfig(mapConfig)
  .setUserContext(userContext);

Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The merge operations are executed on the partition threads.
Database accesses are slow compared to in-memory operations.
The `SplitBrainMergePolicy.merge()` method is called for every key-value pair or
every collection from your smaller cluster, which has a merge policy defined.
So there can be millions of database accesses due to a merge policy, which implements this.
Be aware that this can block your cluster for a long time or overload your database due to the high amount of queries.

Also, the `com.hazelcast.core.LifeCycleEvent.MERGED` is thrown
after a timeout (we don't wait forever for merge operations to continue).
At the moment this timeout is 500 milliseconds per merged item or entry, but at least 5 seconds.
If your database is slow, you might get the `LifeCycleEvent` while there are still merge operations in progress.
====

=== Merge Policies With Multiple Merge Types

You can also write a merge policy, which requires multiple merge types.
This merge policy is supported by all data structures, which provide `MergingHits` and `MergingCreationTime`:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/networkpartitioning/ComposedHitsAndCreationTimeMergePolicy.java[tag=ch]
----

If you configure this merge policy on a data structures, which does not provide these merge types,
you get an `InvalidConfigurationException` with a message like:

```
The merge policy org.example.merge.ComposedHitsAndCreationTimeMergePolicy
can just be configured on data structures which provide the merging type
com.hazelcast.spi.merge.MergingHits.
See SplitBrainMergingTypes for supported merging types.
```

=== Merge Policies For Specific Data Structures

It's also possible to restrict a merge policy to a specific data structure.
This merge policy, for example, only works on `IMap`:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/networkpartitioning/MapEntryCostsMergePolicy.java[tag=me]
----


If you configure it on other data structures, you get an `InvalidConfigurationException` with a message like:

```
The merge policy org.example.merge.MapEntryCostsMergePolicy
can just be configured on data structures which provide the merging type
com.hazelcast.spi.merge.SplitBrainMergeTypes$MapMergeTypes.
See SplitBrainMergingTypes for supported merging types.
```

This is another example for a merge policy, which only works on
the `IAtomicReference`:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/networkpartitioning/AtomicReferenceMergeIntegerValuesMergePolicy.java[tag=ar]
----


Although every data structure supports `MergingValue`, which is
the only merge type of `AtomicReferenceMergeTypes`, this merge policy is restricted to `IAtomicReference` data structures:

```
The merge policy org.example.merge.AtomicReferenceMergeIntegerValuesMergePolicy
can just be configured on data structures which provide the merging type
com.hazelcast.spi.merge.SplitBrainMergeTypes$AtomicReferenceMergeTypes.
See SplitBrainMergingTypes for supported merging types.
```

=== Best Practices

Here are some best practices when implementing your own merge policy

* Only call `MergingValue.getValue()` and `MergingEntry.getKey()` when you really need
the deserialized value to save costs (CPU and memory) and avoid `ClassNotFoundException`.
* If you want to return one of the given values (merging or existing),
it's best to return `mergingValue.getRawValue()` or `existingValue.getRawValue()`,
since they are already in the correct in-memory format of the data structure.
If you return a deserialized value, it might need to be serialized again, which are avoidable costs.
* Be careful with slow operations in the merge policy (like database accesses),
since they block your partition threads. Also, the `LifeCycleEvent.MERGED` or
`LifeCycleEvent.MERGE_FAILED` may be thrown too early, if the merge operations take too long to finish.

== Eliminating Unsuccessful Cluster Merges

In some cases, Hazelcast Platform members which initially can form a cluster (join to each other) may not be
able to recover from the split-brain even though the network failure which caused the split-brain is healed.
The reason is that the master member of the cluster, which responsible for initiating the healing, fails to discover the other cluster's master member, so the split-brain merge process never begins.

Considering the scenario when you are scaling-up a cluster. You need to add new members because the initial member count in the cluster is insufficient.
The IP addresses of these new members may not exist in the configurations of
the initial set of members, since the new addresses are not added into the configurations of the initial members while starting them.
So, in a cluster with a long lifecycle, some members may not have the address of every other member, resulting in split-brain recovery failures.

To overcome this issue, you can use the following REST endpoint to update the member list on the cluster members at runtime.

[source,shell]
----
/hazelcast/rest/config/tcp-ip/member-list
----

You can send a `GET` request to the above endpoint to retrieve the current member list from the member and a `POST` request for updating the member list.

The following is the cURL command to retrieve the member list, and its response format:

[source,shell]
----
curl http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/config/tcp-ip/member-list

{"status":"success","member-list":["<member-1-address>","<member-2-address>","<member-3-address>", ...]}
----

The following is the cURL command to update the member list, and its response format:

[source,shell]
----
curl --data-urlencode "<cluster-name>" --data-urlencode "" --data-urlencode "<member1-address>,<member2-address>,<member3-address>" http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/config/tcp-ip/member-list

{"status":"success","message":"The member list of TCP-IP join config is updated at run time. ","member-list":["<member1-address>","<member2-address>","<member3-address>"]
----

[NOTE]
====
If xref:security:overview.adoc[security] enabled and xref:security:simple-authentication.adoc[custom member authentication] is used in your cluster, the cURL command to update the member list would
look like the following.

curl --data-urlencode "<username>" --data-urlencode "<password>" --data-urlencode "<member1-address>,<member2-address>,<member3-address>" http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/config/tcp-ip/member-list
====

For these requests to work, you need to enable the `CLUSTER_READ` and `CLUSTER_WRITE` endpoint groups, respectively, in the cluster members. See xref:maintain-cluster:rest-api.adoc#enabling-endpoint-groups[Enabling Endpoint Groups].

By using this REST endpoint, you are able to add the missing addresses of the members from the other cluster to your members. Therefore, one cluster master member will find the other cluster's master member.
