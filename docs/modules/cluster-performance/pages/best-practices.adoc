This section provides guidance on optimizing your Hazelcast deployment for performance, reliability, and operational excellence. The following topics cover essential best practices across multiple areas: 

* xref:ROOT:capacity-planning.adoc[] — for resource estimation and cluster sizing.
* xref:cluster-performance:performance-tips.adoc[] — for tuning your production environment.
* xref:cluster-performance:back-pressure.adoc[] and xref:cluster-performance:pipelining.adoc[] — for optimizing throughput.
* xref:cluster-performance:aws-deployments.adoc[] — for cloud-specific considerations.
* xref:cluster-performance:threading.adoc[] — for efficient operation execution.
* xref:cluster-performance:near-cache.adoc[] — for reducing latency.
* xref:cluster-performance:imap-bulk-read-operations.adoc[] — for preventing out-of-memory issues.
* xref:cluster-performance:data-affinity.adoc[] — for optimizing data locality.
* xref:cluster-performance:security-best-practices.adoc[] — for planning and optimizing security.

Additionally, refer to xref:test:testing-bestpractices.adoc[Testing best practices] for guidance on writing reliable and efficient tests for your Hazelcast applications, and xref:cp-subsystem:best-practices.adoc[CP Subsystem best practices] for optimizing strongly consistent data structures and distributed coordination use cases.
