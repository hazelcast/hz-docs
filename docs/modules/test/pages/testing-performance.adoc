= Introduction to Hazelcast Performance Testing with Simulator

*NOTE: THIS CONTENT IS WORK IN PROGRESS*

== Overview

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-simulator[Hazelcast Simulator]
 is a high-performance, production-grade testing framework for running performance, stress, and latency tests on Hazelcast clusters. It allows engineers to simulate complex workloads and evaluate distributed systems in a realistic and reproducible manner.

Simulator supports testing both open-source and enterprise editions of Hazelcast and is particularly suited for:

- Validating new features
- Detecting regressions
- Measuring throughput and latency under varying loads
- Simulating real-world failures (e.g., network latency, node crashes)
- Running tests against cloud-deployed Hazelcast clusters

== Key Capabilities

- Supports both *throughput* and *latency*-oriented testing modes.
- Orchestrates tests across multiple clients and members, with configurable topologies.
- Provides out-of-the-box support static infrastructure, (support for cloud deployments is not yet available).
- Integrates with monitoring tools and profilers for system-level analysis.
- Enables custom test logic with a flexible Java-based test API.

== Supported Test Types

Simulator enables the execution of a variety of performance test types:

- *Load Tests:* Combined throughput and latency under realistic load.
- *Max Throughput Tests:* Identify system saturation points under increasing concurrency.
- *Latency Tests:* Measure operation response time at fixed request rates.
- *Spike and Soak Tests:* Evaluate short bursts and long-term stability.
- *Stress Tests:* Push the system until failure to observe limits.

== Performance Testing Strategy

Before executing tests:

- Use a test plan to define test scope, goals, and configurations.
- Choose appropriate *machine types*, *network configuration*, and *topology*.
- Consider persistence, CPU, memory, and network bandwidth requirements.

During test execution:

- Start with a small cluster and gradually increase load (`threadCount`, `ratePerSecond`).
- Monitor key metrics (TPS, latency percentiles, CPU, memory).
- Use Simulatorâ€™s latency and ramp-up utilities for controlled testing.

== Configuration and Setup

Test scenarios are defined in a `tests.yaml` file which specifies:

- Cluster size (`members`, `clients`)
- JVM arguments and Hazelcast version
- Test classes and their parameters
- Load profiles (e.g., `putProb: 0.2`, `getProb: 0.8`)
- Rate controls (`ratePerSecond`, `interval`)

Hazelcast Simulator uses an `inventory.yaml` file to manage machine provisioning and network setup. Tests can be executed on any static set of hosts (support for cloud deployments coming soon).

== Advanced Features

- **Network Latency Simulation:** Inject delays between groups of machines.
- **CP Subsystem Testing:** Configure CP member priorities using `cp_priorities`.
- **Flight Recorder Integration:** Enable JFR for profiling with `member_args`.
- **Warmup/Cooldown:** Configure warmup and cooldown periods to improve report accuracy.

== Tooling and Reporting

Simulator supports automated HTML report generation via `perftest report`. Reports include:

- Throughput and latency graphs
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
- Comparison across multiple benchmarks

For analysis and profiling, the following tools are commonly used:

- `async-profiler`, `VisualVM`, `JFR`
- `iperf`, `tc`, `fio` for system/network load
- `dstat` for real-time system metrics

== Best Practices

- Use small clusters for early iteration, scale gradually as needed.
- Avoid burstable cloud instances; prefer fixed-bandwidth machines.
- Archive test artifacts and reports for regression tracking.
- Prefer deterministic test logic to reduce noise and variability.

== Installing and Running Hazelcast with Simulator

This section outlines how to install Hazelcast, configure it for testing, and run performance tests using Hazelcast Simulator.

=== Install Hazelcast Enterprise

Tested on: Ubuntu Server 24.04

Follow the official guide to start a local cluster:
xref:https://docs.hazelcast.com/tutorials/cli-local-cluster[Start a Local Cluster with the CLI]

Install Hazelcast Enterprise:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt update && sudo apt install hazelcast-enterprise=5.5.6
----

Apply the license key as described in:
xref:https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/licensing/manage-license[Managing Enterprise Edition License Keys]

Edit `/usr/lib/hazelcast/config/hazelcast.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <license-key>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</license-key>
  ...
</hazelcast>
----

Verify installation:

[source,shell]
----
which hz
hz start
----

(Press `CTRL+C` to stop the node.)

=== Configuration

Hazelcast configuration directory: `/usr/lib/hazelcast/config`

Adjust `jvm.options`:

[source]
----
-XX:+UseZGC
-Xms4g
-Xmx4g
----

Update `hazelcast.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="hazelcast.socket.bind.any">true</property>
----

=== Test with CLI Client

On a separate host, unpack `hazelcast-enterprise-5.5.6`, then edit `config/hazelcast-client.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
<cluster-members>
  <address>server_host_ip_address</address>
</cluster-members>
----

Finally, run the client to connect to the cluster:

[source,shell]
----
bin/hz-cli cluster
----

The expected output is:

----
State: ACTIVE
Version: 5.5.6
Size: 1
ADDRESS            UUID
[127.0.0.1]:5701   efd7b55e-...
----

=== Using Simulator for Performance Testing

Hazelcast Simulator can be run via Docker. It organizes performance tests into "projects".

The local directory for projects will be `$HOME/work/simulator-projects`.

==== Create and Access a Project

Create and access a project:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/work/simulator-projects":/simulator/projects \
  -w /simulator/projects \
  --entrypoint bash \
  hazelcast-simulator:latest
----

Create a new project named `test1`:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/work/simulator-projects":/simulator/projects \
  -w /simulator/projects \
  hazelcast-simulator:latest \
  create test1
----

Add the SSH public key to your cluster nodes:

[source,shell]
----
cd test1/
ssh-copy-id -i key.pub root@10.0.0.10
ssh -i key root@10.0.0.10
----

Edit `hazelcast-client.xml` as before to connect to cluster members.

==== Inventory Plan

Create `test1/inventory.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
loadgenerators:
  hosts:
    192.168.1.101:
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: key
      ansible_user: root
      private_ip: 192.168.1.101
----

==== Install Java and Simulator on Remote Hosts

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/work/simulator-projects":/simulator/projects \
  -w /simulator/projects \
  --entrypoint inventory \
  hazelcast-simulator:latest \
  install java

docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/work/simulator-projects":/simulator/projects \
  -w /simulator/projects \
