When you deploy Hazelcast clusters on AWS EC2 instances, you can place the
cluster members on the same https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-cluster[Cluster Placement Group]. This approach can drastically reduce latency among members.
Additionally, you can also consider using private IPs
instead of public ones to increase the throughput when the cluster
members are placed in the same VPC.

For the best performance of your Hazelcast on AWS EC2:

* Select the newest Linux AMIs.
* Select the HVM based instances.
* Select at least a system with 8 vCPUs, for example, c4.2xlarge. For an overview of all types of
EC2 instances, refer to https://www.ec2instances.info[this web page^].
* Consider setting a placement group.
