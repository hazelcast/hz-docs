= Security Interceptor
:page-enterprise: true

Hazelcast allows you to intercept every remote operation executed
by the client. This lets you add a very flexible custom security logic.
To do this, implement `com.hazelcast.security.SecurityInterceptor`.

The `before` method is called before processing the request on the
remote server. The `after` method is called after the processing.
Exceptions thrown while executing the `before` method are propagated
to the client, but exceptions thrown while executing the `after` method
are suppressed.
