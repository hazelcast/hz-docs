= Move to {enterprise-product-name} from {open-source-product-name}
:description: With Enterprise Edition, you can benefit from additional and extended features, patch releases, Hazelcast Support, and more connectors. If you are using the Open Source Edition and want to upgrade to Enterprise, you can do this with clusters of the same version from 5.5.

{description}

The {open-source-product-name} Edition does not include the following, which are included with an Enterprise license:

* Long term support (LTS) releases and short term support (STS) releases. For more information on LTS and STS releases, see xref:migrate:lts.adoc[]

* Data Migration Tool. For more information on the Data Migration Tool, see xref:migrate:data-migration-tool.adoc[]
* Patch releases, including those for security vulnerabilities from March 2024
* Hazelcast Support with defined SLAs. For more information on the benefits of Hazelcast Support, see xref:getting-started:support.adoc[]

NOTE: To use the following {enterprise-product-name} features they might need to be enabled on your {enterprise-product-name} license, and must be configured after all members have been moved to {enterprise-product-name}. 
For further information on the license requirements and configuration, see the linked documentation for the specific feature.

* Security persistence. For more information on storing sensitive data on disk, see xref:secure-cluster:hardening-recommendations.adoc[]
* CP Subsystem. For more information on building a strongly consistent layer for a set of distributed data structures that withstands server and client failures, see xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[]
* High-Density Memory Store (HD Memory). For more information on Hazelcast's in-memory storage solution, which supports predictable application scaling and improved performance while minimizing pauses caused by garbage collection, see xref:storage:high-density-memory.adoc[]
* WAN Replication. For more information on synchronizing the state of multiple Hazelcast clusters across a WAN, see xref:wan:wan.adoc[]
* Rolling upgrades. For more information on upgrading the members of a cluster without downtime, see xref:maintain-cluster:rolling-upgrades.adoc[]
* Thread-Per-Core (TPC). For more information on improving the system performance by using one thread for networking, storage, and compute on each CPU, see xref:cluster-performance:thread-per-core-tpc.adoc[]
* User Code Namespaces. For more information on using a container for Java classpath resources, such as user code and accompanying artifacts, see xref:clusters:user-code-namespaces.adoc[]
* Helm charts, with the exception of link:https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast[Community-driven Open Source Helm Charts, window=_blank]. For more information on using the Helm package manager for Kubernetes with Hazelcast, see xref:kubernetes:deploying-in-kubernetes.adoc[]
* Updates to connectors available before version 5.4
* Any connectors added after version 5.4 
+
For more information on Connectors, see xref:integrate:connectors.adoc[].

In addition, if you are using our tools, {open-source-product-name} does not include the following:

* Hazelcast Operator to support your Kubernetes deployments. For more information on Operator, refer to the link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest/[Hazelcast Operator, window=_blank] documentation
* Client filtering, Prometheus Exporter, Config Health Check, clustered REST, or JMX support in Hazelcast Management Center
+
Management Center also disables with clusters of more than three members.

For more information on Management Center, refer to the xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center::index.adoc[Management Center, window=_blank] documentation.

== High-level Process

To upgrade your {open-source-product-name} cluster to an {enterprise-product-name} cluster of the same version, you can use a rolling restart.

The rolling restart supports the IMap, ReplicatedMap, and Topic data structures.

For each member in the {open-source-product-name} cluster, the rolling restart process is as follows:

. Shut down the member and wait for all partitions to migrate to the rest of the cluster
. Upgrade the member's codebase
. Restart the member

You must not configure the {enterprise-product-name} features that you want to use until all members have been successfully moved from {open-source-product-name} to {enterprise-product-name}.

For further information on rolling restarts, see xref:migrate:rolling-restart.adoc[].
