= Configure the CP Subsystem
:description: You can configure clusters to enable the CP Subsystem and adjust other options such as CP groups sizes and persistence of CP state.

{description}

== Quickstart

Use this quickstart to test the CP Subsystem in development. The CP Subsystem is disabled by default, with any CP data structures operating in xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc#unsafe-mode[unsafe mode]. 

NOTE: Running clusters must be restarted before any configuration changes take effect.

. To enable the CP Subsystem, configure a non-zero value for the <<cp-member-count, `cp-member-count`>> option:

. Restart the cluster.

[[persistence]]
== Persist CP data structures

To enable xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc#persistence[CP Subsystem persistence], set the <<persistence-enabled, `persistence-enabled`>> option to `true`.

When CP Subsystem persistence is enabled, all Hazelcast cluster members -- including AP members -- create a directory under the base `cp-data` directory. CP members persist CP state in these sub-directories. AP members persist only their status as non-CP members. Ensure that you do not delete these directories unless you need to remove stale data to recover the system as described in <<ap-cp, CP Subsystem persistence and AP persistence>>.

To change the base directory, set a value in the <<base-dir, `base-dir`>> option.

[[ap-cp]]
=== CP Subsystem persistence and AP persistence

Hazelcast also offers xref:storage:persistence.adoc[persistence] for some AP data structures. If you persist AP and CP data structures in a single Hazelcast cluster, be aware that member or cluster restarts can fail if the persisted data (CP or AP) becomes stale.

You can configure AP members to automatically remove stale data with the `auto-remove-stale-data` option -- see xref:storage:configuring-persistence.adoc[Configuring persistence]. Otherwise, you will need to remove stale data manually.

CP members can usually rejoin the cluster after a restart. The CP group leader will reissue any missing operations to catch up the rejoining member's Raft log. However, if a CP member gets significantly out of sync, you may need to remove stale data manually.

== Choose a group size

For all xref:cp-subsystem.adoc#cp-groups[CP groups], you can set the number of CP members that should participate in each one using the <<group-size, `group-size`>> option.

To scale out throughput and memory capacity, you can choose a CP group size that is smaller than the <<cp-member-count, CP member count>> to distribute your CP data structures to multiple CP groups.

NOTE: If you want to distribute CP data to a group other than `DEFAULT`, you must specify the group name when creating or fetching the CP data structure proxy.

CP groups must consist of three, five, or seven members. An odd number of CP members avoids stalemate scenarios in leadership elections and quorum calculations.

For a CP group of `N` members:

* the majority of members is calculated as `(N + 1) / 2`.
* the number of failing members the group can tolerate is calculated as `(N - 1) / 2`.

For example, in a CP group of five CP members, operations are committed when they are replicated to at least three CP members. This CP group can tolerate the failure of two CP members and remain available.

Creating separate CP groups allows clients to distribute the load among the leaders of several CP groups. However, a large number of CP groups running on the same members may slow down the system. A good compromise is to create the same number of CP groups as CP members for high throughput use cases. That way, each member will usually be the leader of one group.

You should xref:cp-subsystem:management.adoc#destroying-a-cp-group-by-force[destroy] any unused CP groups.

[[configuring-leadership-priority]]
== Configure leadership priority

Some CP members are better leadership candidates than others. For example, members in your local data center are better candidates because of the reduced latency to clients, and members under high load are poor candidates because they are more likely to suffer from downtime. To maximise the availability and throughput of the CP subsystem, you can configure CP members with a priority rating, using the <<cp-member-priority, `cp-member-priority`>> option.

On startup, any CP member with any priority can become a leader and `cp-member-priority` has no effect. The background leadership rebalancing task periodically transfers the leadership from CP members with the lowest priorities to those with higher priorities within each CP group. Eventually, all CP group leaders are CP members with high priorities.

Only CP members that are part of a CP group can become leaders. CP members that are not in a CP group do not participate in the leadership rebalancing task. For example, you start a cluster with the CP group size set to three and all members with priority 0. Later, you configure a new CP member with priority 100. Even though it has a higher priority, the new CP member never becomes a leader because the CP group is full. The new CP member is eligible for leadership only when a CP member leaves the CP group and the new CP member takes the previous member's place.

IMPORTANT: <<cp-member-priority, `cp-member-priority`>> does not override the Raft leadership election process: it is a hint rather than a rule. Consequently, it is possible that a member with a low priority becomes leader for a period until the background leadership rebalancing task transfers the leadership to a member with a higher priority. The leadership rebalancing task runs approximately every 60 seconds; however, a custom frequency can be defined by the system property `hazelcast.raft.leadership.rebalance.period`. If necessary, you can also <<autostepdown, configure members to transfer leadership>> to another member if elected.

[[autostepdown]]
== Configure members to transfer leadership

In some deployment scenarios, you may want to prevent a CP group member from becoming the leader. For example, if your CP group is distributed across two local data centers and one remote data center for geographic redundancy, there may be a significantly higher latency to the remote data center.

image:autostepdown-deployment.svg[Distributed CP Group deployment]

If the CP group leader is in one of the local data centers -- and there are enough local followers to achieve quorum -- the leader will not need to wait for acknowledgements from followers in the remote data center and so the increased latency will have no impact. If the leader is in the remote data center, there will be a higher latency for client operations and this will reduce the maximum throughput achievable. To maximize throughput, you can force CP members in the remote data center to automatically transfer leadership to another member by enabling <<auto-step-down-when-leader, `auto-step-down-when-leader`>>. The increased latency will then only have an impact if a remote data center member is needed to achieve quorum.

In the Raft algorithm, a member must become leader if it has the most recent log in the group. In this case, a member with <<auto-step-down-when-leader, `auto-step-down-when-leader`>> enabled will become leader but immediately trigger the leadership rebalancing task, and will reject client operations. If the leadership rebalancing task fails, it will retry automatically. Client operations continue to be rejected until a new leader is elected.

Reducing the number of leadership candidates reduces the fault tolerance of the CP Subsystem. You should therefore only enable this feature if it is necessary to achieve your throughput requirements, and you should enable it on as few members as possible. This feature does not apply to the `METADATA` group, which is not sensitive to latency.

[[sessions]]
== Configure CP sessions

xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc#sessions[Sessions] offer a trade-off between liveness and safety. If you set a small value for the <<session-time-to-live-seconds,`session-time-to-live-seconds`>> option, a session owner could be considered crashed very quickly and its resources could be released prematurely. On the other hand, if you set a large value, a session could be kept alive for an unnecessarily long duration after its owner crashes. We recommend using the default `session-time-to-live-seconds` duration. If a session owner is known to have crashed, you can close its session manually by calling this method on the handler side: `CPSessionManagementService#forceCloseSession(String, Long)`.

[[fencedlock-configuration]]
== Configure fenced locks

By default, fenced locks are reentrant. This means that once a caller has acquired the lock, the same caller can acquire it again multiple times in a linearizable manner without releasing it first.

You can configure the reentrancy behavior with the <<lock-acquire-limit,`lock-acquire-limit`>> option. For example, reentrancy can be disabled by setting this option to `1`, making the lock a non-reentrant mutex. You can also set a custom reentrancy limit. When the reentrancy limit is reached, the fenced lock fails with link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/cp/lock/exception/LockAcquireLimitReachedException.html[LockAcquireLimitReachedException] or a specified return value.

== Configure semaphores

By default, a caller must acquire permits before releasing them and it cannot release a permit that it has not acquired. This means that you can acquire a permit from one thread and release it from another thread, using the same caller, but not different callers. In this mode, acquired permits are automatically released upon failure of the caller.

To enable a permit to be released without acquiring it first, enable JDK compatibility by setting the `jdk-compatibility` option to `true`.

WARNING: When `jdk-compatibility` is set to `true`, Hazelcast does not auto-cleanup acquired permits upon caller failures. If a permit holder fails, its permits must be link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/cp/ISemaphore.html#release(int)[released manually].

[[remove]]
== Remove missing CP members

If CP Subsystem persistence is disabled, CP members lose their state after shutting down and so cannot rejoin the CP Subsystem. You can configure CP members to be automatically removed from the CP Subsystem after they shut down as well as how long to wait after they shut down before removing them.

By default, missing CP members are automatically removed from the CP Subsystem after four hours and are replaced by other CP members if any are available. You can configure this time using the <<missing-cp-member-auto-removal-seconds,`missing-cp-member-auto-removal-seconds`>> option.

If a missing CP member rejoins the cluster after it is automatically removed from the CP Subsystem, that CP member must be terminated manually. See xref:maintain-cluster:shutdown.adoc#shutting-down-a-hazelcast-member[Shutting Down a Hazelcast Member].

If no CP members are available to replace a missing CP member, the group size of any groups that it was in is reduced and the majority values are recalculated. The CP group will continue to function as long as a majority of the configured number of CP members remains available.

When CP Subsystem persistence is enabled, CP members are not automatically removed from the CP Subsystem. These CP members can restore their CP state from disk and rejoin their CP groups. It is your responsibility to xref:management.adoc#remove-a-cp-member[remove CP members] if they do not restart.

[[IndeterminateOperationStateException]]
== Handle indeterminate operation state

When you invoke an API method on a CP data structure, the method replicates an internal operation to the corresponding CP group. After the CP leader commits this operation to the majority of the CP group, it sends a response to the public API call. If a failure causes loss of the response, then the caller cannot determine if the operation is committed on the CP group or not.

You can handle loss of the response in two ways:

- To allow CP leaders to replicate the operation to the CP group multiple times, set the <<fail-on-indeterminate-operation-state,`fail-on-indeterminate-operation-state`>> option to `false` (default).
- To send an `IndeterminateOperationStateException` back to the caller, set the `fail-on-indeterminate-operation-state` option to `true`.

== Global configuration options

Use these options to configure the CP Subsystem.

|[[leader-heartbeat-period-in-millis]]`leader-heartbeat-period-in-millis`
|Interval in milliseconds at which a CP group leader sends periodic heartbeat messages to its followers to indicate its liveness. Periodic heartbeat messages are actually append entries requests and can contain log entries for the lagging followers. If too small a value is set, heartbeat messages are sent from leaders to followers too frequently and it can cause an unnecessary usage of CPU and network bandwidth.

|[[max-missed-leader-heartbeat-count]]`max-missed-leader-heartbeat-count`
|Maximum number of missed CP group leader heartbeats for a follower to trigger a new leader election round. For example, if `leader-heartbeat-period-in-millis` is `1000` and this value is set to
`5`, then a follower triggers a new leader election round if five seconds pass after the last heartbeat message of the current leader. If this
duration is too small, new leader election rounds can be triggered
unnecessarily if the current leader temporarily slows down or a network congestion occurs. If it is too large, it takes longer to detect failures of leaders.

|[[commit-index-advance-count-to-snapshot]]`commit-index-advance-count-to-snapshot`
|Number of new commits to initiate
a new snapshot after the last snapshot taken by the local CP group member. This value
affects performance of the system in multiple ways. If a small value is set, it means 
that snapshots are taken too frequently and CP group members keep a very short Raft log. 
If snapshots are large and CP Subsystem persistence is enabled, this can create a high overhead on I/O
performance. Moreover, a leader can send too many snapshots to followers
and this can create a high overhead on network use. On the other hand, if
a very large value is set, it can create a memory overhead since Raft log
entries are going to be kept in memory until the next snapshot.

|[[uncommitted-entry-count-to-reject-new-appends]]`uncommitted-entry-count-to-reject-new-appends`
|Maximum number of
uncommitted log entries in the leader's Raft log before temporarily rejecting
new requests of callers. Because leaders send log entries to followers in
batches, they accumulate incoming requests to improve the throughput.
You can configure this field by considering your degree of concurrency in your
callers. For instance, if you have at most `1000` threads sending requests to
a CP group leader, you can set this field to `1000` so that callers do not get
retry responses unnecessarily.

entries request either until the follower responds or this timeout occurs.
