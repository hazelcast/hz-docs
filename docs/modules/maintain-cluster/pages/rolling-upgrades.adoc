= Upgrade to a new version
:description: You can use a rolling upgrade to upgrade the version of Hazelcast members in a running cluster without interrupting the operation of the cluster.

{description}

If you are moving members from a {open-source-product-name} cluster to an {enterprise-product-name} cluster, use an in-place rolling restart instead of a rolling upgrade. See xref:migrate:rolling-restart.adoc[].

If you used Hazelcast Operator to deploy your cluster, follow the upgrade procedure in the link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest/scaling-upgrading#upgrading[Operator documentation, window=_blank] instead.

[[hazelcast-members-compatibility]]
== Upgrade compatibility

Hazelcast uses semantic versioning, where versions appear in the following format:

`major.minor.patch`

For example, in version `5.1.0`, `5` is the major version, `1` is the minor version, and `0` is the patch version.

[[terminology]]
.Glossary
[cols="1e,1a"]
|===
|Term|Definition

|member codebase version
|The `major.minor.patch` version of the
Hazelcast binary on which the member executes. For example, when running
on `hazelcast-5.2.jar`, your member's codebase version is `5.2.0`.

|cluster version
|The `major.minor` version at which the cluster
operates. This ensures that cluster members are able to communicate using
the same cluster protocol and
determines the feature set exposed by the cluster.
|===

To allow you to use rolling upgrades, Hazelcast provides the following GA (general availability) release compatibility:

- Hazelcast members operating on the same major and minor cluster version are always compatible, regardless of patch version.

- Each minor version is compatible with the previous one.

As a result, you can use rolling upgrades to upgrade clusters to the following member codebase versions:

- A new patch version of the same major and minor version ({open-source-product-name} and {enterprise-product-name})
- The next minor version of the same major version ({enterprise-product-name} only)
+
This also includes the ability of rolling upgrade from Hazelcast IMDG 4.2 to Platform 5.0, since IMDG is part of the Platform and 5.0 is considered to be the next minor version after IMDG 4.2.

NOTE: Following the rolling upgrade, you must resubmit jobs as they don't run during the upgrade. For further information on the compatibility of job states in upgrades, see xref:deploy:versioning-compatibility.adoc#job-states[Versioning and Compatibility].

[[updated-jdk]]
== Upgrade JDK version

As newer JDK releases contain improvements, we recommend that you upgrade to a newer JDK version where xref:deploy:versioning-compatibility.adoc#supported-java-virtual-machines[supported].

Upgrade the JDK version before upgrading your members if support for the JDK version has changed between your current and planned cluster versions. For example, in 5.2 JDK 8 or later was supported, but 5.5 supports only JDK 17 or later.

== Enable automatic cluster upgrades

The cluster can automatically upgrade its version when it detects 
that all its members have a version higher than the current cluster 
version, it upgrades the cluster version to match it. This feature is
disabled by default. To enable it, set the system property 
`hazelcast.cluster.version.auto.upgrade.enabled` to `true`.

Note that because you are shutting down and upgrading 
the members one by one, when you shut down the last one, all the members 
in the remaining cluster have the newer version, but you don't want the 
auto-upgrade to kick in before you have successfully upgraded the last
member as well. To avoid this, you can use the 
`hazelcast.cluster.version.auto.upgrade.min.cluster.size` system
property. You should 
set it to the size of your cluster, and then Hazelcast will wait for the
last member to join before it can proceed with the auto-upgrade.

== Prerequisites

* You will need the JAR file for your new version. You can download the JAR file from link:https://hazelcast.com/get-started/download/[the Hazelcast website].

* You can use Management Center or the xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc#using-the-hz-cluster-admin-script[hz-cluster-admin] script to set the cluster version.
** To use Management Center, you need to upgrade Management Center before upgrading the members. See xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:getting-started:overview.adoc#hazelcast-cluster-compatibility[Hazelcast Cluster Compatibility] for the list of versions that Management Center can set the cluster version to.
** To use `hz-cluster-admin`, you must enable the `CLUSTER_WRITE` REST endpoint group (disabled by default). See
xref:maintain-cluster:rest-api.adoc#using-the-rest-endpoint-groups[REST Endpoint Groups].

* Plan sufficient time for the migration and upgrade to complete, and remember that the members cannot change during the upgrade.

[[rolling-upgrade-procedure]]
== Perform a rolling upgrade

IMPORTANT: If you deployed your cluster using Hazelcast Operator, follow the steps in the link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest/scaling-upgrading#upgrading[Operator documentation] instead.

To upgrade your cluster, complete the following steps:

. Gracefully shut down the first member:
+
[tabs]
====
CLI::
+
IMPORTANT: This command shuts down all running members on the local machine.
+
--
[source,bash]
----
hz-stop
----
--

Management Center::
+
--
Go to *Members*, select the member's row in the table and select *Shutdown*.
--

Docker::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
docker stop <CONTAINER_NAME>
----
--
====

. Wait until all partition migrations are completed. You can monitor the progress of migrations on the xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:clusters:dashboard.adoc[cluster dashboard] in Management Center.
+
During migrations, members cannot join or leave the cluster.

. Upgrade the member's codebase to the new version. You can do this by replacing the Hazelcast JAR file in your installation directory.

. Start a new member.
+
[tabs]
====
CLI::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
hz start
----
--

Docker::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
docker start <CONTAINER_NAME>
----
--
====

. Wait until the new member joins the cluster and all partition migrations are completed. Again, you can monitor progress using the xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:clusters:dashboard.adoc[cluster dashboard] in Management Center.
+
You should see something like the following in your logs:
+
```
 ...
 INFO: [192.168.2.2]:5701 [cluster] [{new codebase version}] <1>
 Hazelcast Enterprise {new codebase version} (20170630 - a67dc3a) starting at [192.168.2.2]:5701
 ...
 INFO: [192.168.2.2]:5701 [cluster] [{new codebase version}] Cluster version set to {previous codebase version} <2>
```
+
<1> The member's codebase version. Once the member locates the existing cluster members, it sends its join request to the master member. The master member validates that the new member is allowed to join the cluster and lets the new member know that the cluster is currently operating on the previous cluster version.
<2> The member sets its cluster version to the previous one and starts operating normally.
+
WARNING: Do not run members on different codebase versions for prolonged periods of time.

. Repeat this process for each member in the cluster.

. [[upgrading-cluster-version]]When all members have been updated, trigger a rolling upgrade on the cluster using one of the following methods:
+
* xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:cluster-administration.adoc#rolling-upgrade[Management Center].
+
* xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc#using-the-hz-cluster-admin-script[hz-cluster-admin] script.
+
* Allow the cluster to <<enabling-auto-upgrading, auto-upgrade>>.

The cluster is now operating on the new codebase version: both the codebase version and the cluster version have been upgraded.

[[network-partitions-and-rolling-upgrades]]
== Network partitions and rolling upgrades

In the event of network partitions which split your cluster into two subclusters,
split-brain handling works as explained in the
xref:network-partitioning:network-partitioning.adoc[Network Partitioning chapter],
with the additional constraint that two subclusters only merge as long as they operate
on the same cluster version. This is a requirement to ensure that all members participating
in each one of the subclusters are able to operate as members of the merged cluster at
the same cluster version.

With regards to rolling upgrades, the above constraint implies that if a network
partition occurs while a change of cluster version is in progress, then with some
unlucky timing, one subcluster may be upgraded to the new cluster version and another
subcluster may have upgraded members but still operate at the old cluster version.

In order for the two subclusters to merge, it is necessary to change the cluster
version of the subcluster that still operates on the old cluster version, so that
both subclusters will be operating at the same, upgraded cluster version and able
to merge as soon as the network partition is fixed.

[[rolling-upgrade-faq]]
== Upgrade FAQ

The following provide answers to the frequently asked questions related to rolling member upgrades.

**How is the cluster version set?**

When a new member starts, it is not yet joined to a cluster; therefore its
cluster version is still undetermined. In order for the cluster version to be
set, one of the following must happen:

* the member cannot locate any members of the cluster to join or is configured
without a joiner: in this case, the member appoints itself as the master of a
new single-member cluster and its cluster version is set to the `major.minor` version
of its own codebase version. So a standalone member running on codebase version `5.2.0`
sets its own cluster version to `5.2`.
* the member that is starting locates members of the cluster and identifies which is
the master: in this case, the master validates that the joining member's codebase version
is compatible with the current cluster version. If it is found to be compatible, then
the member joins and the master sends the cluster version, which is set on the joining
member. Otherwise, the starting member fails to join and shuts down.

**What if a new Hazelcast minor version changes fundamental cluster protocol communication, like join messages?**

NOTE: The version numbers used in the paragraph below are only used as an example.

On startup, as answered in the above question (How is the cluster version set?),
the cluster version is not yet known to a member that has not joined any cluster.
By default the newly started member uses the cluster protocol that corresponds to
its codebase version until this member joins a cluster
(so for codebase `5.2.0` this means implicitly assuming cluster version `5.2`).
If, hypothetically, major changes in discovery & join operations
have been introduced which do not allow the member to join a `5.1` cluster,
then the member should be explicitly configured to start
assuming a `5.1` cluster version.


**Do I have to upgrade clients to work with rolling upgrades?**

Clients which implement the Open Binary Client Protocol
are compatible with Hazelcast version 3.6 and newer minor versions.
Thus, older client versions are compatible with next minor versions. Newer clients
connected to a cluster operate at the lower version of capabilities until
all members are upgraded and the cluster version upgrade occurs.


**Can I stop and start multiple members at once during a rolling member upgrade?**

It is not recommended due to potential network partitions.
It is advised to always stop and start one member in each upgrade step.


**Can I upgrade my business app together with Hazelcast while doing a rolling member upgrade?**

Yes, but make sure to make the new version of your app compatible with the old
one since there will be a timespan when both versions interoperate.
Checking if two versions of your app are compatible includes verifying
binary and algorithmic compatibility and some other steps.

It is worth mentioning that a business app upgrade is orthogonal to a
rolling member upgrade. A rolling business app upgrade may be done without upgrading the members.

**Are features marked as Beta in my current version upgraded?**

Features marked as Beta in the source version are upgraded, but are supported only in a cluster of the same version as the source version due to changes that can occur between releases. 

This means that you can encounter failures if, for example, changes have been made to the field format or where there is a SQL dependency. Following any failure, where the Beta feature has been updated or made generally available in the target version, the updated version of the feature is used.

**Can I upgrade directly to the latest release?**

You can upgrade directly to the latest release in the following circumstances:

* Your source version is no more than one minor version below the latest (target) version
