== Security

* **Security Fix for CVE-2025-30065 - Updated Parquet dependency**: Addressed a critical vulnerability in the hazelcast-sql
module affecting 5.4.x and 5.5.x, flagged by Palo Alto Prisma Cloud and scored CVSS 10.0 Critical by Apache. 
The fix updates the Parquet dependency to a secure version, mitigating the risk of exploitation.
* **Bump spring-boot-starter-parent to address Tomcat CVEs**: Updated the spring-boot-starter-parent dependency to a newer minor version to resolve Tomcat vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-31651, CVE-2025-24813) that were present in the previous version, ensuring the platform is not affected by these security issues.


== Fixes

* **Fixed 'Content is not allowed in prolog' exception on server triggered by MC connection**: Resolved an XML error that occurred when Management Center 5.6.0 connected to Hazelcast 5.5.2 with certain YAML configurations, eliminating unnecessary server log errors.
* **Fixed loss of Continuous Query Cache events and NullPointerExceptions under high load**: Improved event serialization logic to prevent NullPointerExceptions and event loss in large, busy clusters, ensuring reliable CQC updates even during heavy workloads.
* **Fixed high latency in near cache tests for 6K+ clients**: Analyzed and addressed the root cause of extremely high latency in near cache scenarios, improving performance for large-scale deployments.
* **Fixed JVM crash during shutdown by delaying HD expiry storage disposal**: Ensured that HD expiry storage is disposed only after all operation threads are stopped, preventing memory access errors and JVM crashes at shutdown.
* **Fixed dangling pointers in HD global index by including expired entries**: Modified the cleanup process to remove expired data from the global index, preventing query threads from encountering invalid memory references and JVM crashes.
* **Fixed event thread imbalance for batched invalidation events**: Improved the distribution of batched invalidation events across event threads to prevent event queue overload, resolving steadily increasing operation latency during large client count workloads with near cache enabled.
* **Fixed missing correlation id for memberGroupsViewEvent**: Ensured that correlation ids are set for memberGroupsViewEvent updates, eliminating warnings and dropped packets due to missing message identifiers.
* **Updated expiry metadata handling to use thread-local cache**: Prevented threads from modifying expiry metadata of others by using thread-local instances, improving concurrency safety during expiry checks.
* **Updated AWS RegionValidator regex to support new regions**: Enhanced the regex to match all current AWS regions, ensuring compatibility with new AWS region names and improving validation accuracy.
* **Added details of invalid NativeMemoryData to query exceptions**: Improved error reporting by including more information about invalid NativeMemoryData encountered during indexed queries, aiding in troubleshooting and diagnostics.
* **Fixed phone home metrics corruption in Hazelcast EE 5.5.0**: Ensured that all Hazelcast Platform {enterprise-product-name} instances send complete and correct phone home metrics, regardless of distribution channel, preventing loss of essential monitoring data.
