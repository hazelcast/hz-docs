== Security
* *Resolved gRPC security vulnerabilities and updated Python support for Jet transforms:* Fixed multiple vulnerabilities (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p9rf-64qj-22rw[CVE-2024-11407] and https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xwmg-2g98-w7v9[CVE-2025-53864]) by upgrading the gRPC dependency, which required dropping support for Python 3.7 in Python-based transforms. Those transforms in Data Pipelines now require at least Python 3.8.0. This is a *breaking change only for users still on Python 3.7*, which is already end-of-life.
* *Resolved https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q4rv-gq96-w7c5[CVE-2024-13009], https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mmhx-hmjr-r674[CVE-2024-45801], https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gx9m-whjm-85jf[CVE-CVE-2024-47875], and https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vhxf-7vqr-mrjg[CVE-2025-26791] in Jetty:* Fixed multiple vulnerabilities by upgrading the Jetty dependency.
* *Resolved https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r7pg-v2c8-mfg3[CVE-2024-47561] in Apache Avro:* Fixed a vulnerability by upgrading the Apache Avro dependency.
* *Resolved https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfxw-4h78-h7fw[CVE-2024-25638], https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xjp4-hw94-mvp5[CVE-2024-29131], and https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wxr5-93ph-8wr9[CVE-2025-48734] in Apache Hadoop:* Fixed multiple vulnerabilities by upgrading the Apache Hadoop dependency.
* *Resolved https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-735f-pc8j-v9w8[CVE-2024-7254] in Protobuf:* Fixed an information disclosure vulnerability by upgrading the Protobuf dependency.
* *Resolved https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wr62-c79q-cv37[CVE-2025-52520], https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-25xr-qj8w-c4vf[CVE-2025-53506], and https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jmp9-x22r-554x[CVE-2025-41249] in Spring Boot:* Fixed multiple vulnerabilities by upgrading the Spring Boot dependency.
* *Resolved https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-prj3-ccx8-p6x4[CVE-2025-55163] in Netty:* Fixed HTTP/2 control frame handling vulnerability by upgrading the Netty dependency.
* *Resolved https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gqp3-2cvr-x8m3[CVE-2025-48989] in Apache Tomcat Embed:* Fixed an issue about improper resource shutdown by upgrading the Apache Tomcat embed dependency. 

== Fixes
* *Fixed delayed cleanup of job resources in Jet jobs:* Resolved an issue where job resource IMaps were not deleted eagerly on job completion and instead lingered until the 2-hour default expiration, increasing memory usage and cleanup overhead. The fix restores immediate deletion of job resources  and corrects cleanup when resource uploads partially fail for files and directories.
* *Fixed incorrect filtering of non-expired entries in global indexes:* Enhanced the thread-safe handling of expired entries in global indexes (originally addressed in 5.4.3), where a race condition allowed one thread to modify expiry metadata while another was reading it. This bug could cause non-expired entries to be incorrectly filtered out from query results. The fix ensures consistent expiry metadata access across threads so that only truly expired entries are excluded.
