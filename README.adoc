This repository contains the Antora components for the Hazelcast Platform documentation.

The documentation source files are marked up with AsciiDoc.

== Docs Structure

This section describes some important information about how this repository is structured:

- The component name, version, and start page are configured in each branch's `antora.yml` file.
- The navigation for all modules is stored in the ROOT module's `nav.adoc` file.
- The {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] instructs Antora to automatically build the site using content in the `main` branch as well as any branches that are prefixed with `v/`.

== Release Workflow

Documentation for new releases is hosted in versioned branches that are prefixed with `v/`. The `latest-dev` content (snapshot content) is stored in the `main` branch.

We support documentation for the latest patch releases of minor versions. For example, content for the `5.0` version is hosted in the `v/5.0` branch. This branch contains content for the latest patch release of version 5.0.

NOTE: The documentation build process is triggered whenever you create a new branch with the `v/` prefix, push to an existing `v/` branch, or push to the `main` branch.

=== Snapshot Releases

Add the new snapshot version to the following:

- `asciidoc.attributes.page-latest-supported-java-client`
|===

=== Patch Releases

In the `v/` branch for the minor version whose patch you are releasing, update the `asciidoc.attributes.full-version` field in the `antora.yml` file to the new patch version. For example, if you are releasing version 5.0.3, find the `v/5.0` branch and update the `asciidoc.attributes.full-version` field in the `antora.yml` file with 5.0.3.

NOTE: As soon as you push content to this branch, GitHub will trigger a new build of the site, which will include your new content.

=== Creating Release Branches

. If you are releasing a new major version, create a release branch from the `main` branch.
+
For example, if you are releasing version 5.1, create a new release branch named `5.1` from the `main` branch.

. Update the fields mentioned in <<latest-releases, Latest Releases>>.

. Remove the `prerelease: true` field from the docs/`antora.yml` file of the `hz-docs` repository.
+
IMPORTANT: If you are creating a branch for a beta release, do not remove this field.

. When you are ready to release, create a maintenance branch from the release branch.
+
NOTE: As soon as you push the maintenance branch to the repository, GitHub will trigger a new build of the site, which will include your new content.

. Make sure to delete the release branch.
+
For example, if you released version `5.1`, delete the `5.1` branch. This step helps to keep the repository clean of release branches.

== npm scripts

For deployment and development this repository includes the following npm scripts:

.npm scripts
[cols="m,a,a"]
|===
|Script |Description |Notes

|`npm run build`
|Builds a production version of the docs from this repo
|This script depends on Netlify env vars (`REPOSITORY_URL` and `BRANCH`) which you can encode using e.g.: `export REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/hazelcast/hz-docs && export BRANCH=pull/445/head && npm run build`
You should generally just use build-local though.

|`npm run build-local`
|Builds a local version of the docs from this repo
|By default, it will build all content sources taken from the link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docs/blob/main/antora-playbook.yml[global antora-playbook]. But if you want to build less, please modify the local link:./antora-playbook.yml[antora-playbook].

|`npm run validate-docs`
|Validates docs
|It will take into consideration all content sources taken from the link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docs/blob/main/antora-playbook.yml[global antora-playbook].

|`npm run check-orphan-pages`
|Checks orphan pages
|
|===

NOTE: Before running any of the scripts please make sure you have installed all latest npm packages via `npm i`.
