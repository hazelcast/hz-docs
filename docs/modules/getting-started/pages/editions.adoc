This page includes detailed information on features available with each edition, as well as information on licensing permissions.

== {enterprise-product-name} versus {open-source-product-name}

Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} is a licensed product that extends the {open-source-product-name} offering to provide many additional features and benefits, plus a xref:support#customer-support.adoc[Hazelcast Customer Support] subscription. 

TIP: Get a free {enterprise-product-name} trial from https://hazelcast.com/get-started/?utm_source=docs-website[Try Hazelcast].

Hazelcast {open-source-product-name} is free and covered by an Apache License, Version 2.0, and a https://hazelcast.com/hazelcast-community-license/?utm_source=docs-website[Hazelcast Community License]. The permissions granted in these licenses allow you to do the following:

* Use the {open-source-product-name} 
* Reproduce the {open-source-product-name} 
* Distribute the {open-source-product-name} with any open and/or closed source applications

NOTE: {enterprise-product-name} features are marked with an [.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}* label in this documentation. All pre-existing Hazelcast licenses, such as the Pro/Enterprise/Enterprise HD licenses,
are valid for Hazelcast Platform. Each edition has its own installation file i.e. you can't turn a {open-source-product-name} into an {enterprise-product-name} by adding a license key.

The following table explains which features are available in Hazelcast Platform based on your license:
