= Configuring Logging
:description: Options available for the logging mechanism of Hazelcast clusters.
:page-aliases: clusters:logging-configuration.adoc

Hazelcast has a flexible logging configuration and does not depend on
any logging framework except JDK logging. It has built-in adapters
for a number of logging frameworks and it also supports custom loggers
by providing logging interfaces.

== Locating the Logs

If you start a member using the `hz-start` script from the Hazelcast distribution package, the logs are written
to `<HAZELCAST HOME>/logs` directory by default. The logs are configured to roll over daily.
Note that the logs are also shown in the terminal where you start the member while it is up and running.

In case you use Docker to start a member, the logs are written to stdout.
You can use the `docker logs <Hazelcast container ID>` command to see the member logs at any point in time. The container ID can be seen using `docker ps`.
You can also use `docker logs -f <Hazelcast container ID>` to follow the logs in real-time.

== Setting Logging Type

To use the built-in adapters, set the `hazelcast.logging.type` property
to one of the predefined types below:

* **jdk**: JDK logging (default)
* **log4j**: Log4j
* **log4j2**: Log4j2
* **slf4j**: Slf4j
* **none**: disable logging

The following shows how you can set this property:

NOTE: If you choose to use `log4j`, `log4j2`, or `slf4j`, you should include
the proper dependencies in the classpath.

== Logging Pattern

The default log output resembles the following example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
2022-02-16 11:40:52,463 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.system]: [172.18.0.2]:5701 [hello-world] [{full-version}] Copyright (c) 2008-2022, Hazelcast, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
2022-02-16 11:40:52,463 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.system]: [172.18.0.2]:5701 [hello-world] [{full-version}] Hazelcast Platform {full-version} (20220210 - 1d718cf) starting at [172.18.0.2]:5701
2022-02-16 11:40:52,463 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.system]: [172.18.0.2]:5701 [hello-world] [{full-version}] Cluster name: hello-world
----

The logging pattern is shown below.

[source,plain]
----
[Date and time] [Log level] [Thread name] [Logger Class Name] [Member IP and port] [Cluster name] [Platform version] [Log message]
----

You can customize the default logging pattern using the `LOGGING_PATTERN`
environment variable while starting a member.

Here is an example usage.

[tabs] 
==== 
CLI::
+ 
--
[source,bash]
----
LOGGING_PATTERN='{"time":"%date{ISO8601}", "logger": "%logger{36}", "level": "%level", "msg": "%enc{%m %xEx}{JSON}"}%n' bin/hz start
----
--

Docker::
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    -e LOGGING_PATTERN='{"time":"%date\{ISO8601\}", "logger": "%logger\{36\}", "level": "%level", "msg": "%enc{%m %xEx}\{JSON\}"}%n' \
    hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----
====

== Specifying Logging Configuration File

You can specify the logging configuration file using the `LOGGING_CONFIG`
environment variable. If it is not set, the default `<HAZELCAST HOME>/config/log4j2.properties` is used;
you can change the logging configuration by modifying this file.

Here is an example usage.

[tabs] 
==== 
CLI::
+ 
--

Provide the file's relative or absolute path, or a file in the `<HAZELCAST HOME>/config` directory.

[source,bash]
----
LOGGING_CONFIG=config/myHzConfig.properties bin/hz start
----
--

Docker::
+
--

Provide the file's relative or absolute path.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    -e LOGGING_CONFIG=config/myHzConfig.properties \
    hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----
--
====

You can also provide a properties file having a path of your choice. For Log4j2, you can specify this using the following JVM argument (which is the only way for Log4j2).

```
-Dlog4j.configurationFile=/path/to/properties/log4j2.properties
```

== Modifying the Default Logging

If you do not need detailed logs, the default settings are enough.
Using the Hazelcast specific lines in the default configuration file,
you can select to see specific logs (cluster, partition, hibernate, etc.) in desired levels:

[source,shell]
----
...
...
#Hazelcast specific logs.
#logger.com.hazelcast=debug

#logger.com.hazelcast.cluster=debug
#logger.com.hazelcast.partition=debug
...
....
----

To enable the debug logs for all Hazelcast operations, uncomment the below line
in the configuration file:

```
logger.com.hazelcast=debug
```

You can also use the `hazelcast.logging.details.enabled` property to
specify whether the name, IP address and version of the cluster are included
in the logs. When there are lots of log lines, it may be hard to follow.
When set to `false`, those information will not appear.

== Using JSON Template

You can use JSON templates for the member log files.
The JSON logging configuration file built on the default JSON template layout is `<HAZELCAST HOME>/config/log4j2-json.properties`.

You can use a different JSON template via the `LOGGING_JSON_TEMPLATE` environment variable. Here is an example usage.

[tabs] 
==== 
CLI:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,bash]
----
LOGGING_CONFIG=log4j2-json.properties LOGGING_JSON_TEMPLATE="classpath:EcsLayout.json" bin/hz start
----
--

Docker::
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    -e LOGGING_CONFIG=config/log4j2-json.properties \
    -e LOGGING_JSON_TEMPLATE="classpath:EcsLayout.json" \
    hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----
====

See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/json-template-layout.html#event-templates[Event Templates] for available templates.

== Changing Log Levels for JDK Logging

As mentioned in the introduction of this section above, the default
logging type of Hazelcast is JDK logging.

The default logging level is `INFO`.

You can change the JDK logging level as follows while starting a member.

[tabs] 
==== 
Docker:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    -e LOGGING_LEVEL=FINE \
    hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----
--

Java member API::
+
[source,java]
----
java.util.logging.Logger rootLogger = LogManager.getLogManager().getLogger("");
rootLogger.setLevel(Level.FINE);
for (Handler h : rootLogger.getHandlers()) {
    h.setLevel(Level.FINE);
}
----
====

== Dynamically Changing Log Levels

You can change log levels without the need of restarting the cluster members.
This may be useful while monitoring or diagnosing the events in your cluster.

This feature is supported for the default (JDK/JUL), Log4j, and Log4j2 frameworks.
The Slf4j framework is not supported since it does not provide any log level changing APIs.

You can use either of the following ways to dynamically change the level of your cluster's logs:

* Using JMX API: The logging service exposes its JMX MBean as `LoggingServiceMBean`.
You can retrieve, set, and reset the level. See the
<<monitoring-with-jmx, Monitoring with JMX section>>.
* Using REST API: You can use the `/hazelcast/rest/log-level` REST endpoint to retrieve (`GET`),
set (`POST`), and reset (`DELETE`) the level. See the xref:clients:rest.adoc#using-the-rest-endpoint-groups[REST Endpoint Groups section].

== Logging for Client and Embedded Mode

When using Hazelcast through the client or in embedded mode, Hazelcast doesn't
automatically add any dependencies to any logging framework and allows
configuration of which facade the logging should be done through.

To configure the logging facade to use, you need to set a property
in the configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  properties:
    hazelcast.logging.type: log4j2
----

Alternatively, you can use the system property
`-Dhazelcast.logging.type` to configure the logging framework to use.

== Using a Custom Logger

If the provided logging mechanisms are not satisfactory, you can implement
your own using the custom logging feature. To use it, implement the
`com.hazelcast.logging.LoggerFactory` and `com.hazelcast.logging.ILogger`
interfaces and set the system property `hazelcast.logging.class` as your
custom `LoggerFactory` class name.

```
-Dhazelcast.logging.class=foo.bar.MyLoggingFactory
```

== Listening to Logging Events

You can also listen to logging events generated by Hazelcast runtime
by registering ``LogListener``s to `LoggingService`.

[source,java]
----
LogListener listener = new LogListener() {
  public void log( LogEvent logEvent ) {
    // do something
  }
};
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
LoggingService loggingService = instance.getLoggingService();
loggingService.addLogListener( Level.INFO, listener );
----

Through the `LoggingService`, you can get the currently used
ILogger implementation and log your own messages too.

NOTE: If you are not using command line for configuring logging, you should be careful
about Hazelcast classes. They may be defaulted to `jdk` logging before newly configured
logging is read. When logging mechanism is selected, it will not change.
