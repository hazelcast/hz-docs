= {ucd}
:description: The previous method of dynamically loading custom classes or domain classes from other members, or deploying your code from your client was known as {ucd}. This method has been deprecated and will be removed at the next major version. The legacy information for the deprecated {ucd} solution has been retained in this section for your reference.

{description}

{ucn} is only available to Enterprise Edition users.

Hazelcast recommends that Enterprise Edition users migrate to {ucn} to benefit from the improved and extended capabilities that it offers.

After the next major release, Open Source users can either upgrade to Enterprise Edition, or add their resources to the Hazelcast member class paths.

For further information on migrating from {ucd} to {ucn}, see the xref:clusters:ucn-migrate-ucd.adoc[] topic.

For further information on upgrading to Hazelcast Platform from IMDG, see the xref:migrate:upgrading-from-imdg-3.adoc[] or xref:migrate:upgrading-from-imdg-4.adoc[] topics.
