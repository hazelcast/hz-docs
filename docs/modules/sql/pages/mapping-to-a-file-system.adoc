= Creating a Mapping to a File System
:description: To query data in files, you need to create a mapping to a file, using the unified file connector so that the SQL service knows how to access the data.
:page-aliases: sql:file-connector.adoc

{description}

NOTE: You can only read from file mappings. You cannot add data to files.

== What is the Unified File Connector

The unified file connector provides a simple way to read files across different sources. Using this connector, you can read files from the local filesystem, HDFS, and cloud storage systems such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. This connector supports various data formats, including, CSV, JSON, and Avro.

== Installing the Connector

To read from a local or shared filesystem, you do not need to install any additional modules as these are included in Hazelcast.

To access Hadoop or any of the cloud-based file systems, you may need to add one of the downloadable modules listed in
<<supported-storage-systems, Supported Storage Systems>> to your members' classpaths.

Depending on the <<supported-file-formats, format of your files>>, you may also need to add other modules to the classpath.

== Permissions
[.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*

If xref:security:enable-security.adoc[security] is enabled, you can set up permissions to restrict clients' access to your files. For details, see xref:pipelines:job-security.adoc[].

== Configuration Options

Use these options to configure the file connector, using either the xref:select.adoc[`CREATE MAPPING` statement] or a xref:functions-and-operators.adoc#file-table-functions[file table function].

|[[path]]`path` (required)

|The absolute path to a directory in one of the <<supported-file-systems, supported file systems>>.

This option does not support wildcard characters.

If you omit a column list, Hazelcast will try to determine column names and types by reading a sample file in the given directory.

|A filename pattern that uses wildcard characters such as `*` or
`?` to filter the files in the `path` directory.

|If a directory contains JSON files named using the
`YYYY-MM-DD.log` pattern, you can read all the files from January 2020 with the following `glob` argument:

|[[ignoreFileNotFound]]`ignoreFileNotFound`
|`false`
|Return zero results instead of throwing an error when files in the `path` directory are not found.

If you set this option to `true`, you must specify the column list.

This option is not valid for xref:sql:functions-and-operators.adoc#file-table-functions[file table functions], because they always need at least one
record from which to derive the column list.

== Supported File Systems

Hazelcast supports the following file systems.

If you use the slim distribution of Hazelcast, be sure to add the respective modules to your members' classpaths.

NOTE: Any path that does not start with a schema is considered local or shared on the Hazelcast members.

|===

Although these are the officially supported sources, you can also read from
any file system that's compatible with Hadoop.

== Supported File Formats

Hazelcast supports reading from the following file formats.

=== Avro

The Avro format allows you to read data from files in the Avro Object Container File
format. To use the Avro format you must have the
`hazelcast-jet-avro` module on your members' classpaths.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING users
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/users',
    'format' = 'avro',
    'glob' = '*.avro'
)
```

[cols="m,m"]
|===
| Avro type | SQL type

|BOOLEAN
|BOOLEAN

|INT
|INT

|LONG
|BIGINT

|FLOAT
|REAL

|DOUBLE
|DOUBLE

|STRING
|VARCHAR

a| All other types
| OBJECT
|===

=== CSV

CSV files must have a header. If you omit the column
list from the `CREATE MAPPING` statement, Hazelcast will try to infer the column names from the file header. Columns lists that do not match any
header fields are ignored.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'csv'
)
```

All columns have `VARCHAR` type.

=== JSON

JSON files must be in the link:https://jsonlines.org/[JSON Lines] format, where files are expected to contain one valid JSON document per
line and be `UTF-8` encoded. If you omit any mapping columns from the
declaration, Hazelcast infers names and types based on a sample file.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'json-flat'
)
```

=== Parquet

Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format. It describes how the data
is stored on disk. It doesn't specify how the data is supposed to be
deserialized, instead it uses other libraries to achieve that. Hazelcast uses
Apache Avro for deserialization.

Parquet has a dependency on Hadoop, so it can be used only with one of
the Hadoop based modules.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = 'hdfs://path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'parquet'
    /* more Hadoop options ... */
)
```

== Changing the Default Data Type

Depending on the <<supported-file-formats, file format>> that you choose, data is converted to a default SQL type. For example, the CSV format uses the `VARCHAR` type for all fields in the file.

To change this default type, name the columns
explicitly in the column list while creating the mapping. For example, if you specify `INT` manually on a header field of a CSV file, the behavior would be as if `CAST(column
AS INT)` were used to convert `VARCHAR` to `INT`.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_files (
  name VARCHAR,
  id INT
)
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = '/path/to/directory',
    'format' = 'csv'
)
```

For details which data types can be converted to others, see xref:data-types.adoc[].

== Authentication for Remote File Systems

To access data on remote file systems (files that aren't on Hazelcast members), you must also configure the authentication credentials in <<options, `options`>>.

=== Amazon S3

To connect to Amazon S3, you must add the following authentication credentials as keys and values in `options`.

`fs.s3a.access.key`
`fs.s3a.secret.key`

If your file is not stored in the default region (`us-west-1`), you must also provide your region in the `fs.s3a.endpoint` option.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING nasdaqlisted
TYPE File
OPTIONS (
    'path' = 's3a://diagnostic-test-alexander/',
    'format' = 'csv',
    'glob' = 'nasdaqlisted.txt',
    'fs.s3a.endpoint' = 's3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com',
    'fs.s3a.access.key' = 'my-access-key',
    'fs.s3a.secret.key' = 'my-secret-key'
);
```

For additional ways to authenticate see the
link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html#Authenticating_with_S3[Hadoop-AWS documentation]
and
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/credentials.html[Amazon S3 documentation]
.

=== Google Cloud Storage

Provide a location of the keyfile via
`google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile` source option.

NOTE: The file must be available on all cluster members.

For additional ways to authenticate see
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/master/gcs/CONFIGURATION.md#authentication[Google Cloud Hadoop connector].

=== Windows Azure Blob Storage

Provide an account key via
`fs.azure.account.key.<your account name>.blob.core.windows.net` source
option.

For additional ways to authenticate see
link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure/index.html[Hadoop Azure Blob Storage]
support.

=== Azure Data Lake Generation 1

Provide the following options:

- `fs.adl.oauth2.access.token.provider.type`
- `fs.adl.oauth2.refresh.url`
- `fs.adl.oauth2.client.id`
- `fs.adl.oauth2.credential`

For additional ways to authenticate see
link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure-datalake/index.html[Hadoop Azure Data Lake Support]

=== Azure Data Lake Generation 2

For additional ways to authenticate see
link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure/abfs.html[Hadoop Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2]

=== Turning off Authentication Caching

To improve performance, authentication credentials are cached by default. However, cached credentials may cause issues
when xref:pipelines:submitting-jobs.adoc[submitting jobs] that use different credentials, or even the
same jobs with new credentials such as after credentials rotation.

To turn off authentication caching, set the
`fs.<prefix>.impl.disable.cache` option to `true`, where `<prefix>` is the schema of your <<supported-file-systems, file system>>.
