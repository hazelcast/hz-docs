== Listening for Map Events

You can listen to map-level or entry-based events using the listeners
provided by the Hazelcast's eventing framework. To listen to these events,
implement a `MapListener` sub-interface.

A map-level event is fired as a result of a map-level operation, e.g.,
`IMap.clear()` or `IMap.evictAll()`.
An entry-based event is fired after the operations that affect a
specific entry, e.g., `IMap.remove()` or `IMap.evict()`.

Here are the listeners for map-level and entry-based events:

* `EntryAddedListener`: It is notified when an entry is added to the map.
* `EntryEvictedListener`: It is notified when an entry is removed from the map
due to size-based eviction. See the xref:data-structures:managing-map-memory.adoc[Map Eviction section] for more information. 
* `EntryExpiredListener`: It is notified when an entry is removed from the map
due to expiration-based eviction (happens when time-to-live and/or maximum idle seconds are configured
for the entries). If your listener implements both this one and `EntryEvictedListener` together,
the listener may receive both expiration and eviction events for the same entry; this is because,
size-based eviction removes entries regardless of whether entries are expired or not.
* `EntryLoadedListener`: It is notified when an entry is loaded by a `MapLoader` implementation.
* `EntryMergedListener`: It is notified when a WAN-replicated entry is merged.
* `EntryRemovedListener`: It is notified when an entry is directly removed from the map,
for example using IMap's `remove()` method or the REST `DELETE` xref:clients:rest.adoc#removing-entries-from-a-map-for-rest-client[call].
* `EntryUpdatedListener`: It is notified when an entry is updated.
* `EventLostListener`: It is notified when events are lost.
* `MapClearedListener`: It is notified when all the entries of a map are
removed using IMap's `clear()` method.
* `MapEvictedListener: It is notified when all the entries of a map are
removed using IMap's `evictAll()` method.
* `MapPartitionLostListener`: It is notified when the owner and all backups of
a partition is lost for a specific map. See the <<listening-for-lost-map-partitions, Listening for Lost Map Partitions section>>
for details.

=== Catching a Map Event

To catch an event, you should explicitly
implement a corresponding sub-interface of a `MapListener`,
such as `EntryAddedListener` or `MapClearedListener`.

NOTE: The `EntryListener` interface still can be implemented (we kept
it for backward compatibility reasons). However, if you need to listen to a
different event, one that is not available in the `EntryListener` interface, you should also
implement a relevant `MapListener` sub-interface.

Let's take a look at the following class example.

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/distributedevents/Listen.java[tag=listen]
----


Now, let's perform some modifications on the map entries using the following example code.

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/distributedevents/ModifyMap.java[tag=modify]
----


If you execute the `Listen` class and then the `Modify` class, you get the following output
produced by the `Listen` class.

```
Entry Added:EntryEvent{entryEventType=ADDED, member=Member [192.168.1.100]]:5702
 - ffedb655-bbad-43ea-aee8-d429d37ce528, name='somemap', key=11455268066242,
 oldValue=null, value=1, mergingValue=null}

Entry Updated:EntryEvent{entryEventType=UPDATED, member=Member [192.168.1.100]]:5702
 - ffedb655-bbad-43ea-aee8-d429d37ce528, name='somemap', key=11455268066242,
 oldValue=1, value=2, mergingValue=null}

Entry Removed:EntryEvent{entryEventType=REMOVED, member=Member [192.168.1.100]]:5702
 - ffedb655-bbad-43ea-aee8-d429d37ce528, name='somemap', key=11455268066242,
 oldValue=null, value=null, mergingValue=null}
```

NOTE: Please note that the method `IMap.clear()` does not fire an
"EntryRemoved" event, but fires a "MapCleared" event.

NOTE: Listeners have to offload all blocking operations to another thread (pool).


== Listening for Lost Map Partitions

You can listen to `MapPartitionLostEvent` instances by registering an implementation
of `MapPartitionLostListener`, which is also a sub-interface of `MapListener`.

Let's consider the following example code:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/distributedevents/ListenMapPartitionLostEvents.java[tag=lmple]
----

Within this example code, a `MapPartitionLostListener` implementation is registered to a map
that is configured with one backup. For this particular map and any of the partitions in the
system, if the partition owner member and its first backup member crash simultaneously, the
given `MapPartitionLostListener` receives a
corresponding `MapPartitionLostEvent`. If only a single member crashes in the cluster,
there is no `MapPartitionLostEvent` fired for this map since backups for the partitions
owned by the crashed member are kept on other members.

See the xref:cluster-events.adoc#listening-for-partition-lost-events[Listening for Partition Lost Events section] for more
information about partition lost detection and partition lost events.

[[registering-map-listeners]]
=== Registering Map Listeners

After you create your listener class, you can configure your cluster
to include map listeners using the method `addEntryListener` (as you
can see in the example `Listen` class above). Below is the related portion
from this code, showing how to register a map listener.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
IMap<String, String> map = hz.getMap( "somemap" );
map.addEntryListener( new MyEntryListener(), true );
----

With the above approach, there is the possibility of missing events
between the creation of the instance and registering the listener.
To overcome this race condition, Hazelcast allows you to register
listeners in configuration. You can register listeners using declarative,
programmatic, or Spring configuration, as shown below.

The following is an example programmatic configuration.

[source,java]
----
mapConfig.addEntryListenerConfig(
new EntryListenerConfig( "com.yourpackage.MyEntryListener",
                                 false, false ) );
----


The following is an example of the equivalent declarative configuration.

=== Map Listener Attributes

As you see, there are attributes of the map listeners in the above
examples: `include-value` and `local`. The attribute `include-value`
is a boolean attribute that is optional, and if you set it to `true`,
the map event contains the map value. Its default value is `true`.

The attribute `local` is also a boolean attribute that is optional, and
if you set it to `true`, you can listen to the map on the local member.
Its default value is `false`.

== Listening for MultiMap Events

You can listen to entry-based events in the MultiMap using an entry listener.
The following is an example entry listener implementation for MultiMap.

NOTE: The entry listener for MultiMap supports only `entryAdded`, `entryUpdated` and `mapCleared` events.

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/distributedevents/ExampleEntryListener.java[tag=mm]

=== Registering MultiMap Listeners

After you create your listener class, you can configure your cluster to
include MultiMap listeners using the method `addEntryListener`. Below
is the related portion from a code, showing how to register a map listener.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
MultiMap<String, String> map = hz.getMultiMap( "somemap" );
map.addEntryListener( new ExampleEntryListener(), true );
----

With the above approach, there is the possibility of missing events
between the creation of the instance and registering the listener.
To overcome this race condition, Hazelcast allows you to register
listeners in the configuration. You can register listeners using declarative,
programmatic, or Spring configuration, as shown below.

The following is an example programmatic configuration.

[source,java]
----
multiMapConfig.addEntryListenerConfig(
  new EntryListenerConfig( "com.yourpackage.ExampleEntryListener",
    false, false ) );
----

The following is an example of the equivalent declarative configuration.

=== MultiMap Listener Attributes

As you see, there are attributes of the MultiMap listeners in the above
examples: `include-value` and `local`. The attribute `include-value` is
a boolean attribute that is optional, and if you set it to `true`, the
MultiMap event contains the map value. Its default value is `true`.

The attribute `local` is also a boolean attribute that is optional, and
if you set it to `true`, you can listen to the MultiMap on the local member.
Its default value is `false`.


== Listening for Item Events

The Item Listener is used by the Hazelcast `IQueue`, `ISet` and `IList` interfaces.

To write an Item Listener class, you implement the ItemListener
interface and its methods `itemAdded` and `itemRemoved`. These methods
are invoked when an item is added or removed.

The following is an example Item Listener class for an `ISet` structure.

[source,java]
----
public class ExampleItemListener implements ItemListener<Price> {

    @Override
    public void itemAdded(ItemEvent<Price> event) {
        System.out.println( "Item added:  " + event );
    }

    @Override
    public void itemRemoved(ItemEvent<Price> event) {
        System.out.println( "Item removed: " + event );
    }
}
----

NOTE: You can use `ICollection` when creating any of the collection
(queue, set and list) data structures, as shown above. You can also
use `IQueue`, `ISet` or `IList` instead of `ICollection`.

=== Registering Item Listeners

After you create your class, you can configure your cluster to include
item listeners. Below is an example using the method `addItemListener`
for `ISet` (it applies also to `IQueue` and `IList`). You can also see
this portion in the above class creation.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

ICollection<Price> set = hazelcastInstance.getSet( "default" );
// or ISet<Prices> set = hazelcastInstance.getSet( "default" );
set.addItemListener( new ExampleItemListener(), true );
----

With the above approach, there is the possibility of missing events
between the creation of the instance and registering the listener.
To overcome this race condition, Hazelcast allows you to register
listeners in the configuration. You can register listeners using
declarative, programmatic, or Spring configuration, as shown below.

The following is an example programmatic configuration.

[source,java]
----
setConfig.addItemListenerConfig(
new ItemListenerConfig( "com.yourpackage.ExampleItemListener", true ) );
----

=== Item Listener Attributes

As you see, there is an attribute in the above examples: `include-value`.
It is a boolean attribute that is optional, and if you set it to `true`,
the item event contains the item value. Its default value is `true`.

== Listening for Topic Messages

The Message Listener is used by the `ITopic` interface. It notifies
when a message is received for the registered topic.

To write a Message Listener class, you implement the MessageListener
interface and its method `onMessage`, which is invoked
when a message is received for the registered topic.

The following is an example Message Listener class.

[source,java]
----
public class ExampleMessageListener implements MessageListener<MyEvent> {

    public void onMessage( Message<MyEvent> message ) {
        MyEvent myEvent = message.getMessageObject();
        System.out.println( "Message received = " + myEvent.toString() );
    }
}
----

[[reliable-topic-messages]]
== Reliable Topic Messages

link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/topic/ReliableMessageListener.java[ReliableMessageListener] is a link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/topic/MessageListener.java[MessageListener] to better integrate with the reliable topic.

If a standard `MessageListener` is registered on a reliable topic, it acts only as an asynchronous event handler for messages; however, a `ReliableMessageListener` allows you to control the behavior of the listener.

If a `ReliableMessageListener` is registered on a normal `ITopic`, only the methods inherited from `MessageListener` are called.

For example, a Reliable Message Listener class can be defined as follows:
[source,java]
----
    public class ExampleReliableMessageListener implements ReliableMessageListener<Long> {
        private long lastSequence;

        public void onMessage(Message<Long> m) {
            System.out.println("Received: " + m.getMessageObject());
        }

        @Override
        public long retrieveInitialSequence() {
            // The initial sequence to start reading from.
            return 1;
        }

        @Override
        public void storeSequence(long l) {
            // The sequence to store somewhere so that it can be retrieved upon restart.
            lastSequence = l;
            System.out.println("Stored sequence: " + l);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean isLossTolerant() {
            System.out.println("isLossTolerant called");
            // If true, the listener will not be removed upon an exception.
            return false;
        }

        @Override
        public boolean isTerminal(Throwable throwable) {
            System.out.println("isTerminal called");
            return false;
        }

        @Override
        public void onCancel() {
            System.out.println("onCancel called. The listener is being removed.");
        }
    }
----

**Durable Subscription**

You can use the `ReliableMessageListener` to control which message to start processing from when the listener is registered. This supports the creation of a durable subscription by storing the sequence of the last message and then re-starting from the specified `sequenceId`.

**Exception Handling**

The `ReliableMessageListener` also copes with exceptions using the `isTerminal(Throwable)` method. This method allows you to control which exceptions can terminate and cancel the listener. If a `MessageListener` is used, it doesn't terminate following an exception and continues to run. In some situations, such as cluster being stopped, it is better to cancel the listener following the exception.

**Global Order**

The `ReliableMessageListener` always gets all events in order (global order). It does not get duplicates, and gaps (loss of messages) only occur when it is too slow. For more information on dealing with message loss, refer to the `isLossTolerant()` method in the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/topic/ReliableMessageListener.html#isLossTolerant()[Java API documentation^].

**Delivery Guarantees**

The `ReliableMessageListener` controls the item to continue from following a restart, providing an at-least-once or at-most-once delivery guarantee. The `storeSequence(long sequence)` is always called before a message is processed; so it can be persisted on non-volatile storage. When the `retrieveInitialSequence()` returns the stored sequence, an at-least-once delivery is implemented as the same item is processed again. To implement an at-most-once delivery guarantee, add 1 to the stored sequence when the `retrieveInitialSequence()` is called.

**Loss Tolerance**

If this `ReliableMessageListener` can deal with message loss, the `boolean isLosstolerant()` method returns `true`. Even though the reliable topic promises to be reliable, a `MessageListener` can be too slow and eventually this causes the message to become unavailable.

If the `ReliableMessageListener` is not loss tolerant and the topic detects that there are missing messages, the `ReliableMessageListener` terminates.

**onCancel Callback**

This method is called by Hazelcast when the `ReliableMessageListener` is canceled. This can happen when the listener is unregistered, or when it has been canceled due to an exception or shutdown.

=== Registering Message Listeners

After you create your class, you can configure your cluster to include
message listeners. Below is an example using the method `addMessageListener`.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

ITopic topic = hazelcastInstance.getTopic( "default" );
topic.addMessageListener( new ExampleMessageListener() );
----

With the above approach, there is the possibility of missing messaging
events between the creation of the instance and registering the listener.
To overcome this race condition, Hazelcast allows you to register this
listener in the configuration. You can register it using declarative,
programmatic, or Spring configuration, as shown below.

The following is an example programmatic configuration.

[source,java]
----
topicConfig.addMessageListenerConfig(
  new ListenerConfig( "com.yourpackage.ExampleMessageListener" ) );
----

The following is an example of the equivalent declarative configuration.
