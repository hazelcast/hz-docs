= Improving the Performance of SQL Queries
:description: Use this topic to find advice on improving the performance of slow queries.

== Displaying the Execution Plan

Add the keyword xref:sql:explain.adoc[`EXPLAIN`] in front of your query. For example:

[source,sql]
----
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE age > ?;
----


== Ways of Improving Performance

General advice for optimizing SQL queries apply also to Hazelcast SQL queries. However, because Hazelcast is not an RDBMS, there are some differences and special cases.

=== Create indexes

Scanning an entire table (full table scans) is the slowest way to access data, if you are filtering just a small subset of rows. If your queries are performing full table scans on a map, you can create indexes that contain at least one of the columns that the query is filtering in its `WHERE` clause. See xref:create-index.adoc[].

=== Do Not Have Redundant Indexes

Each index has to be updated after each change to the IMap, so there is a tradeoff between read performance and write performance when adding a new index. Both should be evaluated for realistic workload with and without additional index.

=== Create Composite Idexes for Frequently Used Combinations of Fields

SQL queries cannot use more than one SORTED or HASH index for given scan. If you have a query that filters rows using multiple attributes, consider creating a composite index with all these fields instead of or in addition to single-column indexes.

For example, consider an `employees` mapping with the following indexes.

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS emp_age
ON employees (age)
TYPE SORTED;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS emp_name
ON employees (name)
TYPE SORTED;
```

A query like the following is able to utilize only one of the indexes (exactly which one to be used depends on the filter selectivity estimation and cost calculation).

```sql
SELECT * from employees where name = 'Smith' and age > 30
```

You could create the following composite index which covers the query filters.

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS emp_name_age
ON employees (name, age)
TYPE SORTED
```
