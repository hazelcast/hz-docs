== Quickstart

Hazelcast Platform {enterprise-product-name} requires a license key. If you don't have a license key, you can request one at the link:http://trialrequest.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast website].

[source,shell]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
helm install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise --set hazelcast.licenseKey=<license_key>
----

For users who already added `hazelcast` repo to their local helm client before; you need to run `helm repo add` command again to use latest charts at the new chart repo.

[source,shell]
----
helm repo list
----

[source,shell]
----
NAME            URL
hazelcast       https://hazelcast.github.io/charts/
...
----

[source,shell]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
----

[source,shell]
----
NAME            URL
hazelcast       https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
...
----

== Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

[source,shell]
----
helm install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise --set hazelcast.licenseKey=<license_key>
----

The command deploys Hazelcast on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The <<Configuration, configuration>> section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

TIP: List all releases using `helm list` command.

== Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

[source,shell]
----
helm uninstall my-release
----

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

[configuration]
== Configuration

For available configuration properties see link:https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/blob/master/stable/hazelcast-enterprise/values.yaml[enterprise values] file.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value,key=value` argument to `helm install`. For example,

[source,shell]
----
helm install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast \
    --set hazelcast.licenseKey=<license_key>,cluster.memberCount=3
----

The above command sets number of Hazelcast members to 3.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

[source,shell]
----
helm install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast -f values.yaml
----

TIP: You can use the default `values.yaml` with the `hazelcast.license` filled in.

NOTE: Some of the Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} features requires setting `securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem` parameter to `false`. This is the case for the Hot Restart feature or enabling security with OpenSSL. In such cases where `readOnlyRootFilesystem` needs to be set to `true` (i.e. a Pod Security Policy requirement), for Hot Restart to work the JVM parameter `-Djava.io.tmpdir` should be set to a writable location (for example a xref:kubernetes:helm-adding-custom-jar.adoc[custom volume]).

== Notable changes

=== 2.8.0

Hazelcast REST Endpoints are no longer enabled by default and the parameter `hazelcast.rest` is no longer available. If you want to enable REST, please add the related `endpoint-groups` to the Hazelcast Configuration. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
rest-api:
  enabled: true
  endpoint-groups:
    HEALTH_CHECK:
      enabled: true
    CLUSTER_READ:
      enabled: true
    CLUSTER_WRITE:
      enabled: true
----

=== 5.8.0

The parameter `hotRestart` has been renamed to `persistence`. To use the persistence feature make sure that your `values.yaml`
is updated. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
persistence:
  enabled: true
  base-dir: /data/persistence
  validation-timeout-seconds: 1200
  data-load-timeout-seconds: 900
  auto-remove-stale-data: true
----

=== 5.9.0

The section `mcm` are no longer available so the chart will not create required resources to list Hazelcast Platform {enterprise-product-name} at IBM CP4MCM(Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management).

=== 5.10.x

Due to a link:https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/7803[bug in the Helm Project^], the `helm upgrade` command does not allow modifications to the `spec.volumeClaimTemplates` property in stateful sets. This means that upgrades cannot be completed. This issue affect versions between 5.10.7 and 5.10.12.

To avoid this issue, Hazelcast recommends that you upgrade to version 5.10.13 if you are upgrading from a version before 5.10.7.

To upgrade, complete the following steps:

. Export your existing values:
+

[source,bash]
----
helm get values <release-name> -o yaml > values.yaml
----

. Enter the upgrade command with the exported values as follows:
+

[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade <release-name> hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise --version=5.10.13 -f values.yaml
----
