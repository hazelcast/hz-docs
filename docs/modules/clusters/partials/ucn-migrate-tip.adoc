CAUTION: {ucd} has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version. To continue deploying your user code after this time, {open-source-product-name} users can either upgrade to {enterprise-product-name}, or add their resources to the Hazelcast member class paths. Hazelcast recommends that {enterprise-product-name} users migrate their user code to use {ucn} for all purposes other than Jet stream processing. For further information on migrating from {ucd} to {ucn}, see xref:clusters:ucn-migrate-ucd.adoc[].
