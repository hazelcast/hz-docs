= Deploying on Docker
:description: In this deployment guide, you will learn how to form a cluster from Hazelcast member containers running on more than one Docker host in the same local area network (LAN).
:page-aliases: installing-using-docker.adoc

{description}

== Starting a Cluster

The default network mode in Docker is bridge. In this mode, all containers run in a single network that is not accessible outside of the Docker host. If you run member Docker containers on different hosts, you must allow them to discover and connect to each other using one of the following methods:

- Host network mode (Linux only)
- Port mapping

include::deploy:partial$docker-ip-warning.adoc[]

=== Host Network Mode

To allow members and clients on different hosts to discover each other with multicast, you can use the `host` network mode. This mode allows members to share the hostâ€™s network stack from their Docker containers.

Members will discover and connect to each other automatically only if your local network supports multicast. If your network does not support multicast, members will not form a cluster. In this case, you can try <<port-mapping, port mapping>>.

In this mode, each member is available on the internal (private) IP address of the Docker host.

=== Port Mapping

To allow members and clients on different hosts to discover each other over TCP/IP, you can map ports from the Docker host (the device that's running Docker) and tell Hazelcast to listen to your internal IP address.

TIP: You'll need the internal IP address of your Docker host.

. Configure your members to connect over TCP/IP.
+
NOTE: The default configuration file in Docker containers is `/opt/hazelcast/config/hazelcast-docker.xml`.
If you want to use another file, you can specify the path to it relative to the `hazelcast` directory, using the `HAZELCAST_CONFIG` environment variable. You can see an example of this property under <<custom-hazelcast-configuration-file, Custom Hazelcast Configuration File>>.

<3> List the socket address of all your Docker hosts.

. Start a member on the first Docker host.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm --name member1 \
  -e HZ_NETWORK_PUBLICADDRESS=192.168.1.12:5701 -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----

. Start another member on the second host.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm --name member1 \
  -e HZ_NETWORK_PUBLICADDRESS=192.168.1.13:5701 -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----

In the member logs, you should see that your members connected to each other:

```
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
    Member [192.168.1.12]:5701 - a3fc5ee4-df77-484a-82f6-1aa1adfaf3dc
    Member [192.168.1.13]:5701 - 9c1e813d-52df-44c2-9f39-9be9395c7ec6 this
]
```

== Starting Management Center

Hazelcast Management Center provides an easy way to manage and monitor a Hazelcast
cluster from a web page. See the xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:ROOT:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started guide]
for more information.

== Configuration

You can configure various aspects of your cluster and environment with Docker.

We recommend that you use the default
configuration file as a starting point.

=== Memory

By default, Hazelcast configures the JVM with `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80.0`.
This limits the JVM heap to 80% of the RAM available to the container.
We recommend you leave this as-is and control Hazelcast's memory size with the
Docker parameter `--memory`. For example, this will start Hazelcast with 1.6
GB assigned to the JVM:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --memory 2g --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----

=== JAVA_OPTS

To change the JVM parameters directly, use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment
variable. Hazelcast passes it to the JVM when starting. For example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --memory 2g -e JAVA_OPTS="-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=85.0" --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----

Make sure to leave enough free RAM for metaspace and other overheads.

=== Custom Hazelcast Configuration File

You can configure Hazelcast with your own YAML or XML file
by replacing the default ones in the container at
`/opt/hazelcast`:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version} \
cat /opt/hazelcast/config/examples/hazelcast-docker.yaml \
> hazelcast.yml
----

Now edit the file and apply it when starting Hazelcast:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
-v "$(pwd)"/hazelcast.yml:/opt/hazelcast/hazelcast.yml \
-e HAZELCAST_CONFIG=hazelcast.yml \
-p:5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----

=== Extend Hazelcast's CLASSPATH with Custom JARS and Files

If you have to add more classes or files to Hazelcast's classpath, one way to
do it is to put them in a directory such as `ext`, mount it to the
container, and set the `CLASSPATH` environment variable:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
-v /path/to/ext:/opt/hazelcast/ext \
-e CLASSPATH="/opt/hazelcast/ext/" \
-p:5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----

If you have just one file to add, it's simpler to mount it directly to the
Hazelcast `lib` directory:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
-v /path/to/my.jar:/opt/hazelcast-jet/lib/my.jar \
-p:5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}

----

=== Changing Logging Level

You can set the logging level using the `LOGGING_LEVEL` environment
variable:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -e LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----

Available logging levels are (from highest to lowest): `FATAL`, `ERROR`,
`WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`. The default logging level is `INFO`.

If you need more control over logging, you can supply your own
`log4j2.properties` file. Use the default one as the starting point:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version} cat /opt/hazelcast/log4j2.properties > log4j2.properties
----

Edit the file and mount it when starting Hazelcast:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -v /path/to/log4j2.properties:/opt/hazelcast/log4j2.properties hazelcast/hazelcast:{os-version}
----

== Building a Custom Image from the Slim Image

Hazelcast offers a xref:getting-started:editions.adoc#full-slim[slim] Docker image that
contains only the core Hazelcast engine. When image size is a concern, you can use it
as the starting point to build your custom image with just the
extensions you need.

This example creates a Docker image for Hazelcast with the Kafka extension.

[source,dockerfile,subs="attributes+"]
----
FROM hazelcast:{full-version}-slim
ARG HZ_HOME=/opt/hazelcast
ARG REPO_URL=https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast
ADD $REPO_URL/hazelcast-kafka/5.0/hazelcast-kafka-5.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar $HZ_HOME/lib/
# ... more ADD statements ...
----

To build an image from a Dockerfile, use the following command, which gives the image the name `hazelcast-with-kafka`:

[source,bash]
----
docker build . -t hazelcast-with-kafka
----

To start a Docker container from the image:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 5701:5701 hazelcast-with-kafka
----
