= Creating a Transaction Interface

You create a `TransactionContext` object to begin, commit and rollback
a transaction. You can obtain transaction-aware instances of queues,
maps, sets, lists and multimaps via `TransactionContext`, work with
them and commit/rollback in one shot. You can see the TransactionContext API
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/transaction/TransactionContext.html[here^].

Hazelcast supports two types of transactions: ONE_PHASE and TWO_PHASE.
The type of transaction controls what happens when a member crashes
while a transaction is committing. The default behavior is TWO_PHASE.

* **ONE_PHASE**: By selecting this transaction type, you execute the
transactions with a single phase that is committing the changes.
Since a preparing phase does not exist, the conflicts are not detected.
When a conflict happens while committing the changes, e.g., due to a
member crash, not all the changes are written and this leaves the
system in an inconsistent state.
* **TWO_PHASE**: When you select this transaction type, Hazelcast
first tries to execute the prepare phase. This phase fails if there
are any conflicts. Once the prepare phase is successful, Hazelcast
executes the commit phase (writing the changes). Before TWO_PHASE
commits, Hazelcast copies the commit log to other members, so in case
of a member failure, another member can complete the commit.

In a transaction, operations are not executed immediately.
Their changes are local to the `TransactionContext` until
committed. However, they ensure the changes via locks.

For the above example, when `map.put` is executed, no data
is put in the map but the key is locked against changes.
While committing, operations are executed, the value is put
to the map and the key is unlocked.

The isolation level in Hazelcast Transactions is `READ_COMMITTED`
on the level of a single partition. If you are in a transaction,
you can read the data in your transaction and the data that is
already committed. If you are not in a transaction, you can only
read the committed data.

NOTE: The REPEATABLE_READ isolation level can also be exercised
using the method `getForUpdate()` of `TransactionalMap`.

NOTE: The isolation levels might be broken if the objects involved
in the transaction span multiple partitions. A reader which is not
in a transaction can then temporarily observe partially committed data.

== Queue/Set/List vs. Map/Multimap

Hazelcast implements queue/set/list operations differently than
map/multimap operations. For queue operations (offer, poll), offered
and/or polled objects are copied to the owner member in order to safely
commit/rollback. For map/multimap, Hazelcast first acquires the locks
for the write operations (put, remove) and holds the differences (what
is added/removed/updated) locally for each transaction. When the
transaction is set to commit, Hazelcast releases the locks and apply
the differences. When rolling back, Hazelcast releases the locks and
discard the differences.

`MapStore` and `QueueStore` do not participate in transactions.
Hazelcast suppresses exceptions thrown by the store in a transaction.
See the xref:providing-xa-transactions.adoc[XA Transactions section] for
further information.

== ONE_PHASE vs. TWO_PHASE

As discussed in xref:creating-a-transaction-interface.adoc[Creating a Transaction
Interface], when you choose ONE_PHASE as the transaction type, Hazelcast
tracks all changes you make locally in a commit log, i.e., a list of
changes. In this case, all the other members are asked to agree that the
commit can succeed and once they agree, Hazelcast starts to write the changes.
However, if the member that initiates the commit crashes after it has written
to at least one member (but has not completed writing to all other members),
your system may be left in an inconsistent state.

On the other hand, if you choose TWO_PHASE as the transaction type, the commit
log is again tracked locally but it is copied to another cluster member.
Therefore, when a failure happens, e.g., the member initiating the commit
crashes, you still have the commit log in another member and that member can
complete the commit. However, copying the commit log to another member makes
the TWO_PHASE approach slow.

Consequently, it is recommended that you choose ONE_PHASE as the transaction
type if you want better performance, and that you choose TWO_PHASE if reliability
of your system is more important than the performance.

NOTE: It should be noted that in split-brain situations or during a member
failure, Hazelcast might not be able to always hold ACID guarantees.
