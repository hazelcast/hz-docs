include::clients:partial$rest-deprecation.adoc[]

NOTE: To be able to use the REST calls related to WAN Replication
mentioned in this section, you need to enable the `WAN` REST endpoint group.
See the xref:clients:rest.adoc#using-the-rest-endpoint-groups[REST Endpoint Groups section] on how to enable it.

== Parameters

Here is the list of parameters used in the WAN Replication REST calls, which
are shown as placeholders in the REST calls:

* member IP address and port: IP address and port number of the
member on which you run the REST calls.
* `clusterOnSource`: Name of your local (source) cluster.
* `clusterPassword`: Password, if set, of your source cluster.
Note that you need to enable the xref:security:enable-security.adoc[security]
when you need a cluster password. If not set, the parameter is empty.
* `wanRepName`: Name of the WAN Replication configuration.
* `publisherId`: WAN replication publisher ID. If not set,
`cluster-name` under the `batch-publisher` element is used.
* `mapName`: Name of the map to be synchronized.
* `wanConfig`: WAN publisher configuration file, as a JSON string,
to be added dynamically.
* `uuid`: The UUID of the WAN sync operation.

The parameters in the below curl commands need to be provided
in the given order, separated by `&`.

Let's use the following declarative configuration as the example to
be used in the curl commands described in the sections below, and
let's assume that our source cluster does not have a password:

== Clearing the Queues

The URL for clearing the WAN event queues is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/clearWanQueues
```

The following is the curl command: 

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusteronSourceName}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/clearWanQueues
```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows:

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/clearWanQueues
```

IMPORTANT: This endpoint only clears the specified WAN queues of the member it is sent to, it does not clear WAN queues for all members of the cluster.

== Pausing the Publisher

The URL for pausing the WAN publisher is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/pausePublisher
```

The following is the curl command: 

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/pausePublisher
```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows:

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/pausePublisher
```

IMPORTANT: This endpoint only pauses the specified WAN publisher on the member it is sent to, it does not pause WAN publishers for any other members of the cluster.

== Resuming the Publisher

The URL for resuming the WAN publisher is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/resumePublisher
```

The following is the curl command: 

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/resumePublisher
```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows:

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/resumePublisher
```

IMPORTANT: This endpoint only resumes the specified WAN publisher on the member it is sent to, it does not resume WAN publishers for any other members of the cluster.

== Stopping the Publisher

The URL for stopping the WAN publisher is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/stopPublisher
```

The following is the curl command: 

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/stopPublisher
```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows:

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/stopPublisher
```

IMPORTANT: This endpoint only stops the specified WAN publisher on the member it is sent to, it does not stop WAN publishers for any other members of the cluster.

== Synchronizing the Clusters

=== Full Synchronization

For the full synchronization, the URLs for synchronizing a single map and all maps are as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/allmaps
```

The following are the respective curl commands:

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}&{mapName}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map

curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/allmaps

```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows (for that single map):

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london&myMap" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map
```

The following is an example output:

```
{"status":"success","message":"Sync initiated","uuid":"22e1e3d6-1c96-4757-baee-4cd77f1d214e"}
```

IMPORTANT: This endpoint initiates WAN synchronization across the entire cluster, with the receiving member designated as the coordinator for the synchronization process.

=== Delta Synchronization

For the delta synchronization, you need to first perform a
consistency check, using the following REST call URL:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/consistencyCheck/map
```

Here is the respective curl command:

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}&{mapName}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/consistencyCheck/map
```

After the consistency check, you can use the same REST calls
used in full synchronization in the same way to synchronize
a single map or all the maps.

NOTE: Consistency check can be triggered only for one map.

IMPORTANT: This endpoint initiates WAN synchronization across the entire cluster, with the receiving member designated as the coordinator for the synchronization process.

== Tracking the WAN Sync Progress

You can track the progress of a WAN sync operation. The URL is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/progress/uuid
```

The `uuid` can be seen in the output of WAN sync commands as shown in the <<full-synchronization, previous section>>.
Here is the respective curl command for tracking the progress:

```
curl -X GET --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/progress/uuid
```

The following is an example output:

```
{"status":"success","result":{"stage":"FINISHED","progress":100,"wanReplicationName":"wanRepName","wanPublisherId":"publisherId","creationTime":1677839202422}}
```

The output includes the sync progress as a percentage and the stage: `STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `FINISHED` or `FAILED`.

IMPORTANT: As WAN synchronization is an operation that occurs across the cluster, this response represents the WAN sync progress for the entire cluster.

[[wr-dynamically-adding]]
== Dynamically Adding WAN Publishers

The URL for dynamically adding a WAN publisher configuration is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/addWanConfig
```

The following is the curl command: 


```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanConfig}" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/addWanConfig
```

The `wanConfig` parameter should be the full configuration as a JSON string.
See xref:advanced-features.adoc#dynamically-adding-wan-publishers[here] for configuration examples.

IMPORTANT: This endpoint deploys the provided config across all members of the cluster, following the same principles as other dynamic configuration mechanisms.
