= Testing Distributed Applications

This guide explains how to write unit, component, integration, and in-JVM tests for Hazelcast clusters and clients using Hazelcast’s built-in test support utilities.

It covers:

- Creating mock clusters
- Managing members and clients in test code
- Injecting custom configurations
- Isolating tests and cleaning up resources
- Using assertion utilities for distributed state and asynchronous behaviour

Hazelcast provides two primary test support mechanisms:

- `HazelcastTestSupport` for JUnit 4-based testing
- `TestHazelcastInstanceFactory` for JUnit 5 (Jupiter) and general test framework compatibility

For dependencies and tests setup, see: xref:testing-setup.adoc[Testing setup].

== JUnit 4: `HazelcastTestSupport`

Extend `HazelcastTestSupport` to access utility methods for managing in-memory Hazelcast clusters and writing assertions on distributed state.

[source,java]
----
public class MyClusterTest extends HazelcastTestSupport {
    // ...
}
----

Use `createHazelcastInstanceFactory()` to spin up in-process Hazelcast members using a mock network.

[source,java]
----
TestHazelcastInstanceFactory factory = createHazelcastInstanceFactory(2);
HazelcastInstance member1 = factory.newHazelcastInstance();
HazelcastInstance member2 = factory.newHazelcastInstance();
----

To provide a custom configuration:

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config().setProperty("hazelcast.some.property", "value");
HazelcastInstance[] members = factory.newInstances(config, 2);
----

== JUnit 5: `TestHazelcastInstanceFactory`

In JUnit 5, use `TestHazelcastInstanceFactory` directly.

[source,java]
----
class MyJupiterClusterTest {

    private static TestHazelcastFactory factory;
    private static HazelcastInstance member1;
    private static HazelcastInstance member2;
    private static HazelcastInstance client;

    @BeforeAll
    static void setupCluster() {
        factory = new TestHazelcastFactory(2);
        member1 = factory.newHazelcastInstance();
        member2 = factory.newHazelcastInstance();
        client = factory.newHazelcastClient();
    }

    @AfterAll
    static void tearDownCluster() {
        factory.shutdownAll();
    }

    @Test
    void testClusterFormed() {
        assertEquals(2, member1.getCluster().getMembers().size());
    }
}
----

To customise configuration:

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config().setProperty("hazelcast.some.property", "value");
HazelcastInstance member1 = factory.newHazelcastInstance(config);
HazelcastInstance member2 = factory.newHazelcastInstance(config);
----

Note: this class can be used with other test frameworks.

== Creating Clients

Use `TestHazelcastFactory` to create both member and client instances:

[source,java]
----
// JUnit4
TestHazelcastFactory factory = createHazelcastFactory(2);
HazelcastInstance[] members = factory.newInstances(2);
HazelcastInstance client = factory.newHazelcastClient();

// JUnit5
import com.hazelcast.client.test.TestHazelcastFactory;

TestHazelcastFactory factory = new TestHazelcastFactory(2);
HazelcastInstance[] members = factory.newInstances(2);
HazelcastInstance client = factory.newHazelcastClient();
----

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyClusterClientTest {

    @Test
    public void testClientPutAndGetAcrossCluster()
            throws Exception {
        // given: a 2-node in-process cluster with client
        TestHazelcastFactory factory = new TestHazelcastFactory(2);
        HazelcastInstance member1 = factory.newHazelcastInstance();
        HazelcastInstance member2 = factory.newHazelcastInstance();

        HazelcastInstance client = factory.newHazelcastClient();

        member2.getMap("map").put("key0", "value0");
        // when: client puts an entry
        IMap<String, String> clientMap = client.getMap("map");
        clientMap.put("key1", "value1");

        // then: client and cluster see the entry
        assertClusterSizeEventually(2, member1);
        assertTrueEventually(() -> assertEquals("value0", clientMap.get("key0")));
        assertTrueEventually(() -> assertEquals("value1", clientMap.get("key1")));
    }

}
----

== Assertion Methods

`HazelcastTestSupport` offers a rich set of static assertion methods to validate both cluster state and asynchronous behavior. Below are the most commonly used ones.

=== Static imports

For brevity, statically import the methods you need:

[source,java]
----
import static com.hazelcast.test.HazelcastTestSupport.assertClusterSize;
import static com.hazelcast.test.HazelcastTestSupport.assertClusterSizeEventually;
import static com.hazelcast.test.HazelcastTestSupport.assertTrueEventually;
import static com.hazelcast.test.HazelcastTestSupport.assertOpenEventually;
// ...
----

=== Cluster topology assertions

- `assertClusterSize(int expected, HazelcastInstance instance)`
Immediately checks that the given instance sees exactly expected members in its cluster.
- `assertClusterSizeEventually(int expected, HazelcastInstance instance)`
Polls until the cluster reaches the expected size (or fails after a default timeout).

=== Asynchronous condition assertions

`assertTrueEventually(AssertTask task)` repeatedly invokes `task.run()` until it completes without throwing an exception, or a timeout is reached. Use this whenever you need to wait for an async condition to become true.

[source,java]
----
// wait up to the default timeout for the map to contain 3 entries
assertTrueEventually(() -> assertEquals(3, map.size()));
----

Using `assertTrueEventually` for `"false"` conditions you can invert any check by throwing on success. For example, to wait until an entry has been removed:

[source,java]
----
assertTrueEventually(() -> assertFalse(map.containsKey("1")));
----

The following assertions can be used to wait on futures and latches

* `assertOpenEventually(CountDownLatch latch)`
Blocks until `latch.await()` returns, or the default timeout elapses.
* `assertOpenEventually(ICompletableFuture<?> future)`
Waits for the given Hazelcast future to complete.

Overloads accepting a timeout parameter let you customize wait durations:

[source,java]
----
assertOpenEventually(latch, 30);          // seconds
assertTrueEventually(task, 60);          // seconds
----

These methods—especially `assertTrueEventually` and `assertOpenEventually` are indispensable for testing asynchronous behavior in Hazelcast-powered applications. For the full API, see the `HazelcastTestSupport` source in the hazelcast-tests classifier.
