= Split-Brain Protection

Split-brain protection mechanism provided in Hazelcast protects
your cluster in case the number of cluster members drops below the specified one.
How to respond to a split-brain scenario depends on whether consistency of
data or availability of your application is of primary concern.
In either case, because a split-brain scenario is caused by
a network failure, you must initiate an effort to identify and
correct the network failure. Your cluster cannot be brought back to
steady state operation until the underlying network failure is fixed.
If consistency is your primary concern, you can use Hazelcast's split-brain
protection feature.

This feature enables you to specify
the minimum cluster size required for operations to occur.
This is achieved by defining and configuring a `minimum-cluster-size` for the cluster.
If the cluster size is below this minimum value, the operations are rejected and
the rejected operations return a `SplitBrainProtectionException` to their callers.
Additionally, it is possible to configure this size with a user-defined
`SplitBrainProtectionFunction` which is consulted to determine there is no split-brain on
each cluster membership change.

Your application continues its operations on the remaining operating cluster.
Any application instances connected to the cluster with sizes below the minimum threshold
defined by the split-brain protection configuration receive exceptions which, depending on the programming and
monitoring setup, should generate alerts. The key point is that rather than
applications continuing in error with stale data, they are prevented from doing so.

Split-brain protection is supported for the following Hazelcast data structures:

* IMap
* Transactional Map
* ICache
* ILock
* IQueue
* IExecutorService, DurableExecutorService, IScheduledExecutorService,
MultiMap, ISet, IList, Ringbuffer, Replicated Map, Cardinality Estimator,
IAtomicLong, IAtomicReference, ISemaphore, ICountDownLatch
* VectorCollection [.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*

Each data structure to be protected should have the configuration added to
it as explained in the <<configuring-split-brain-protection, Configuring Split-Brain Protection section>>.

== Time Window for Split-Brain Protection

Cluster membership is established and maintained by heartbeats.
A network partitioning presents some members as being unreachable.
While configurable, it is normally seconds or tens of seconds before
the cluster is adjusted to exclude unreachable members.
The cluster size is based on the currently understood number of members.

For this reason, there will be a time window between
the network partitioning and the application of split-brain protection.
Length of this window depends on the failure detector.
Given guarantee is, every member eventually detects
the failed members and rejects the operation on the data structure which
requires the split-brain protection.

Split-brain protection can be
configured with out-of-the-box ``SplitBrainProtectionFunction``s which
determine whether there is a split-brain situation independent of the
cluster membership manager. These functions take advantage of the heartbeat
and other failure-detector information configured on
the Hazelcast members.

For more information, see the xref:consistency-and-replication:consistency.adoc[Consistency and Replication Model chapter].

== Configuring Split-Brain Protection

You can set up the split-brain protection configuration using either
declarative or programmatic mechanism.

Assume that you have a 7-member Hazelcast Cluster and you want to
set the minimum number of four members for the cluster to continue operating.
In this case, if a split-brain happens, the sub-clusters of sizes 1, 2 and 3 are
prevented from being used. Only the sub-cluster of four members is allowed to be used.

NOTE: It is preferable to have an odd-sized initial cluster size to prevent
a single network partitioning (split-brain) from creating two equal sized clusters.

=== Member Count Split-Brain Protection

This type of split-brain protection function determines the presence of split-brain protection based on
the count of members in the cluster, as observed by the local member's cluster
membership manager and is available since Hazelcast 3.5.
The following are map configurations for the example 7-member cluster scenario described above:

=== Probabilistic Split-Brain Protection Function

The probabilistic split-brain protection function uses a private instance of
xref:clusters:failure-detector-configuration.adoc#phi-accrual-failure-detector[Phi Accrual Cluster Failure Detector] which is
updated with member heartbeats and its parameters can be fine-tuned to
determine the count of live members in the cluster, independently of
the cluster's membership manager.

This function has the following configuration elements:

* `acceptable-heartbeat-pause-millis`: Duration in milliseconds corresponding to
the number of potentially lost/delayed heartbeats that are accepted before
considering it to be an anomaly. This margin is important to be able to
survive sudden, occasional, pauses in heartbeat arrivals, due to
for example garbage collection or network drops.
The value must be in the [heartbeat interval , maximum no heartbeat interval] range,
otherwise Hazelcast does not start. Its default value is `60000` milliseconds.
* `suspicion-threshold`: Threshold for suspicion (Ï†) level.
A low threshold is prone to generate many wrong suspicions but
ensures a quick detection in the event of a real crash.
Conversely, a high threshold generates fewer mistakes but
needs more time to detect actual crashes. Its default value is `10`.
* `max-sample-size`: Number of samples to use for
calculation of mean and standard deviation of inter-arrival times.
Its default value is `200`.
* `heartbeat-interval-millis`: Bootstrap the stats with heartbeats that
corresponds to this duration in milliseconds, with a rather
high standard deviation (since environment is unknown in the beginning).
Its default value is `5000` milliseconds.
* `min-std-deviation-millis`: Minimum standard deviation (in milliseconds) to use for
the normal distribution used when calculating phi. Too low standard deviation might
result in too much sensitivity for sudden, but normal, deviations in heartbeat
inter arrival times. Its default value is `100` milliseconds.

=== Split-Brain Protection Configuration Reference

The split-brain protection configuration has the following elements:

* `minimum-cluster-size`: Minimum number of members required in a cluster for
the cluster to remain in an operational state. If the number of
members is below the defined minimum at any time, the operations are
rejected and the rejected operations return a `SplitBrainProtectionException` to their callers.
* `protect-on`: Type of the cluster split-brain protection. Available values are READ, WRITE and READ_WRITE.
* `split-brain-protection-function-class-name`: Class name of a `SplitBrainProtectionFunction` implementation,
allows to configure split-brain protection with a custom split-brain protection function.
It cannot be used in conjunction with `probabilistic-split-brain-protection` or `recently-active-split-brain-protection`.
* `split-brain-protection-listeners`: Declaration of split-brain protection listeners which are
notified on split-brain protection status changes.
* `probabilistic-split-brain-protection`: Configures the split-brain protection with a probabilistic
protection function. It cannot be used in conjunction with `split-brain-protection-function-class-name` or
`recently-active-split-brain-protection`.
* `recently-active-split-brain-protection`: Configures the split-brain protection with a recently-active
protection function. It cannot be used in conjunction with `split-brain-protection-function-class-name`
or `probabilistic-split-brain-protection`.

== Configuring Split-Brain Protection Listeners

You can register listeners to be notified about the split-brain protection results.
Split-brain protection listeners are local to the member where they are registered,
so they receive only events that occurred on that local member.

These listeners can be configured via declarative or programmatic configuration.
The following examples are such configurations.

== Querying Split-Brain Protection Results

Split-brain protection service gives you the ability to
query split-brain protection results over the `SplitBrainProtection` instances.
These instances let you query the result of a particular split-brain protection.

The following is a `SplitBrainProtection` interface that you can interact with.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * {@link SplitBrainProtection} provides access to the current status of a split-brain protection.
 */
public interface SplitBrainProtection {
    /**
     * Returns true if the minimum cluster size is satisfied, otherwise false.
     *
     * @return boolean whether the minimum cluster size property is satisfied
     */
    boolean hasMinimumSize();
}
----

You can retrieve the `SplitBrainProtection` instance as in the following example.
