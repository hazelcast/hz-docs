= Actions and Remedies for Alerts
:description: Find advice for remedies for the Hazelcast alerts.

When an alert fires on a Hazelcast cluster member,
it’s important to gather as much data about the ailing
member as possible to take the suitable action. For this,
you can use the following options.

== Hazelcast Logs

You can collect Hazelcast logs from all members. If you run Hazelcast with
a client-server topology, also collect client application logs before a restart.
See the xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#logging[Logging section] for details.

== Garbage Collection Logs

You can use `jstat` to retrieve garbage collection (GC) logs for a JVM as shown below:

[source,sh]
----
jstat -gcutil -t JAVA_PID 1000 1
----

`JAVA_PID` is the ID of the Hazelcast process which you can find using, e.g., the `top` command.

You can also enable GC logging settings as shown below in your JVM options configuration:

[source,plain]
----
-verbose:gc
-Xloggc:gc.log
-XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=10
-XX:GCLogFileSize=10M
-XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation
-XX:+PrintGCDetails
-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps
-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime
----

You can use the following parameter to specify the location for the GC log file:

[source,plain]
----
-Xloggc:/path/to/your/log/directory/gc.log
----

The JVM options configuration file (`jvm.options`) is located under the `config/` directory
of your Hazelcast distribution. See the xref:configuration:jvm-parameters.adoc[Configuring JVM parameters section] for more information on JVM configuration.

See the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/toc.html[GC Tuning guide] by Oracle for more information about the garbage collection in JVMs.

== Thread Dumps

Make sure you take thread dumps of the ailing member using either the
Management Center (see the Monitoring Members chapters of the Management Center documentation), `jstack`, tools such as visualVM, or a script. Take multiple snapshots of thread dumps
at 3–4 second intervals.

Let's use a script to generate a Java thread dump:

. Note the process ID number of the Java process (`JAVA_PID`), e.g., using `top`.
. Prepare a shell script with the content as shown below; name the script as `threaddump.sh`:
+
```
 #!/bin/sh #
# Takes the Target Java Process PID as an argument. #
# Create thread dumps a specified number of times and INTERVAL. Thread dumps
# will be in the file where stdout was redirected or in console output. #
# Usage: sh ./threaddump.sh #
# Number of times to collect data.
LOOP=6
# Interval in seconds between data points. INTERVAL=20
  for ((i=1; i <= $LOOP; i++))
  do
kill -3 $1
echo "thread dump #" $i if [ $i -lt $LOOP ]; then
echo "Sleeping..."
        sleep $INTERVAL
     fi
done
```
+
. Make the script executable using `chmod 755`. This example script captures
a series of 6 thread dumps spaced 20 seconds apart (modify as needed),
passing in the Java process ID as an argument.
. Kill the process using the `kill -QUIT` or `kill -3` command:
+
```
kill -3 JAVA_PID
```
+
. Run the script as follows:
+
```
sh ./threaddump.sh JAVA_PID
```

Be sure to test the script before the issue happens to make sure it runs properly in your environment.

You can also use `jstack` to generate thread dumps if you run Hazelcast on OpenJDK, or Sun JDK 1.6 or newer (just be sure that your JVM configuration does not include the `-Xrs` parameter):

. Note the process ID number of the Java process (`JAVA_PID`), e.g., using `top`.
. Kill the process using the `kill -QUIT` or `kill -3` command:
+
```
kill -3 JAVA_PID
```
+
. Run the following command to write the thread dump to the `jstack.out` file:
+
```
jstack -l JAVA_PID > jstack.out
```

Alternatively, you can always use the following tools to generate thread dumps:

* http://openjdk.java.net/tools/svc/jconsole/[JConsole^]
* https://visualvm.github.io/[VisualVM^]
* https://github.com/glowroot/glowroot[GlowRoot^]
* http://www.yourkit.com/[YourKit^]
* http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html[JProfiler^]

== Heap Dumps

Make sure you take heap dumps and histograms of the ailing JVM. For this, you can use the JDK's
`jmap` tool:

. Note the process ID number of the Java process (`JAVA_PID`), e.g., using `top`.
. Run the following command:
+
```
jmap -dump:live,file=<file-path> JAVA_PID
```
+
`file=file-path` specifies the name and path of the file where heap dump will be written.

TIP: For more options for capturing a heap dump using JDK tools or the JRE, see this https://www.baeldung.com/java-heap-dump-capture[Baeldung tutorial].

You can also create and run a script. For example:

[source,plain]
----
if [ "x$MIN_HEAP_SIZE" != "x" ]; then
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms${MIN_HEAP_SIZE}"

fi
if [ "x$MAX_HEAP_SIZE" != "x" ]; then
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xmx${MAX_HEAP_SIZE}"
fi

JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseCompressedOops -XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation -XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=10 -XX:GCLogFileSize=20M -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -Xloggc:/path/to/your/log/directory/hazelcast-gc.log.`date +%Y- %m-%d-%H-%M` -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/path/to/your/log/directory/ -verbose:gc -Dlog4j.configuration=file:/path/to/your/log/directory/log4j.properties -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Djava.io.tmpdir=/path/to/your/tmp/directory/tmp/"
