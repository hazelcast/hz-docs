:description: Deploy a Hazelcast cluster in cloud environments including {hazelcast-cloud}, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure.

{description}

All these environments support the following features:

- Allow members to discover each other automatically without static IP configuration.
- Prevent data loss by creating partition backups in other Availability Zones (AZ).

== {hazelcast-cloud}

Deploy a Hazelcast application on xref:cloud:ROOT:overview.adoc[{hazelcast-cloud}].
