// the new 'static' compatibility table

For each Platform version, the table below shows which versions of Management Center (MC), Hazelcast Operator, CLC, and all official clients (Java, .NET, C++, Python, Node.js, Go) are recommended or supported. 

The most recent version is shown in bold to indicate the recommended and most up-to-date option for that Platform version. A " (ditto) character signifies "as above". 

NOTE: If you are unsure which version to choose, always select the latest version for best compatibility and support.
