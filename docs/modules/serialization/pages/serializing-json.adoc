= Serializing into JSON
:description: pass:q[If you want to query JSON strings that are stored in Hazelcast, you can serialize them, using `HazelcastJsonValue`.]

{description}

`HazelcastJsonValue` is a lightweight wrapper that tells a Hazelcast cluster to treat a given string as JSON. Using this information, members can create <<metadata, metadata>> to optimize queries for data in the string. As a result, it's best to use `HazelcastJsonValue` when you want to be able to query JSON values stored in Hazelcast clusters.

== Serializing into `HazelcastJsonValue`

To serialize a JSON string into `HazelcastJsonValue`, pass the string directly to the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/HazelcastJsonValue.html[`new HazelcastJsonValue()`] constructor.

NOTE: Hazelcast does not validate the given string. It is your responsibility to use a well-formed JSON string as a `HazelcastJsonValue`.

[source,java]
----
String person1 = "{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 35 }";
String person2 = "{ \"name\": \"Jane\", \"age\": 24 }";
String person3 = "{ \"name\": \"Trey\", \"age\": 17 }";
String person4 = "{ \"name\": \"Phil\", \"age\": 30 }";
String person5 = "{ \"name\": \"May\"}";

IMap<Integer, HazelcastJsonValue> idPersonMap = instance.getMap("jsonValues");

idPersonMap.put(1, new HazelcastJsonValue(person1));
idPersonMap.put(2, new HazelcastJsonValue(person2));
idPersonMap.put(3, new HazelcastJsonValue(person3));
idPersonMap.put(4, new HazelcastJsonValue(person4));
idPersonMap.put(5, new HazelcastJsonValue(person4));

[[metadata]]
== JSON Metadata

By default, for each `HazelcastJsonValue` object stored in a map, Hazelcast also stores a metadata object, which helps you to query JSON faster.

This metadata object is created every time
a `HazelcastJsonValue` is put into a map and is stored in the on-heap or off-heap
memory, depending on the map's xref:data-structures:setting-data-format.adoc[in-memory format setting].

Depending on your application's needs, you may want
to turn off metadata creation
to both decrease latency when adding objects to a map and to increase throughput. You can configure
this setting using a xref:data-structures:creating-a-map.adoc#writing-json-to-a-map[metadata policy].

== Hazelcast Clients

`HazelcastJsonValue` does not require any Java classes on the member. As a result, clients can serialize data into JSON without any need to upload code to the member.

NOTE: Clients do not validate JSON strings. If you store malformed JSON strings on the cluster, the member will log formatting errors only when you try to query the JSON data.

== SQL

When you map columns to a `json` data type, SQL treats any strings in that column as JSON. As a result, you can either use raw JSON strings or `HazelcastJsonValue`.
