= Get started with the Hazelcast Python Client
:description: This tutorial will get you started with the Hazelcast Python client and show you how to manipulate a map.

== Overview

{description}

This tutorial will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.

== Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

* Python 3.6 or above
* https://cloud.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} Account]
* A text editor or IDE

== Start a Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} Cluster

1. Sign up for a Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} account (free trial is available).
2. Log in to your Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} account and start your trial by filling in the welcome questionnaire.
3. A cluster is created automatically when you start your trial.
4. Press the *Connect Cluster* dialog and switch over to the Advanced setup tab for connection information needed below.
5. From the Advanced setup tab, download the keystore files and take note of your Cluster ID, Discovery Token and Password as you will need them later.

== Set up a Hazelcast Client

Create a new folder and navigate to it:

[source]
----
mkdir hazelcast-python-example
cd hazelcast-python-example
----

Download the Hazelcast Python Client library using pip:

[source]
----
python -m pip install hazelcast-python-client
----

Extract the keystore files you downloaded into this directory. The files you need for this tutorial are:

[source,bash]
----
ca.pem
cert.pem
key.pem
----

== Understand the Python Client

The following section creates and starts a Hazelcast client with default configuration, and connects to your cluster before finally shutting down the client.

Create a Python file named “example.py” and put the following code inside it:

[source,python]
----
import hazelcast
import os

####################################

# Connect to your Hazelcast Cluster
client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
    # Cluster Name and Token
    cluster_name="<YOUR_CLUSTER_ID>",
    cloud_discovery_token="<YOUR_DISCOVERY_TOKEN>",

    # configure SSL
    ssl_enabled=True,
    ssl_cafile=os.path.abspath("ca.pem"),
    ssl_certfile=os.path.abspath("cert.pem"),
    ssl_keyfile=os.path.abspath("key.pem"),
    ssl_password="<YOUR_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD>",
)

# take actions
print("Welcome to your Hazelcast Cluster!")

# Shutdown the client connection
client.shutdown()
----

To understand and use the client, review the https://hazelcast.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html#hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient[Python API documentation] to discover what is possible.

== Understand the Hazelcast SQL API

Hazelcast SQL API is a Calcite SQL-based interface to allow you to interact with Hazelcast much like any other datastore.

In the following example, we will create a map and insert entries into it where the keys are ids and the values are defined as an object representing a city.

[source,python]
----
import hazelcast
from hazelcast import HazelcastClient
from hazelcast.serialization.api import CompactReader, CompactSerializer, CompactWriter
import os
import typing

class City:
    def __init__(self, country: str, city: str, population: int) -> None:
        self.country = country
        self.city = city
        self.population = population

class CitySerializer(CompactSerializer[City]):
    def read(self, reader: CompactReader) -> City:
        city = reader.read_string("city")
        country = reader.read_string("country")
        population = reader.read_int32("population")
        return City(country, city, population)

    def write(self, writer: CompactWriter, obj: City) -> None:
        writer.write_string("country", obj.country)
        writer.write_string("city", obj.city)
        writer.write_int32("population", obj.population)

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "city"

    def get_class(self) -> typing.Type[City]:
        return City

def create_mapping(client: HazelcastClient) -> None:
    print("Creating the mapping...", end="")
    # See: https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/sql/mapping-to-maps
    mapping_query = """

    try:

        client.sql.execute(insert_query).result()
        print("OK.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"FAILED: {e!s}.")

def fetch_cities(client: HazelcastClient) -> None:
    print("Fetching cities...", end="")
    result = client.sql.execute("SELECT __key, this FROM cities").result()
    print("OK.")

    print("--Results of 'SELECT __key, this FROM cities'")
    print(f"| {'id':>4} | {'country':<20} | {'city':<20} | {'population':<15} |")

    for row in result:
        city = row["this"]
        print(
            f"| {row['__key']:>4} | {city.country:<20} | {city.city:<20} | {city.population:<15} |"
        )

NOTE: Ordering of the keys is NOT enforced and results may NOT correspond to insertion order.

== Understand the Hazelcast Map API

A Hazelcast Map is a distributed key-value store, similar to Python dictionary. You can store key-value pairs in a Hazelcast Map.

In the following example, we will work with map entries where the keys are ids and the values are defined as a string representing a city name.

[source,python]
----
import hazelcast
import os

####################################

# Connect to your Hazelcast Cluster
client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
    # Cluster Name and Token
    cluster_name="<YOUR_CLUSTER_ID>",
    cloud_discovery_token="<YOUR_DISCOVERY_TOKEN>",

    # configure SSL
    ssl_enabled=True,
    ssl_cafile=os.path.abspath("ca.pem"),
    ssl_certfile=os.path.abspath("cert.pem"),
    ssl_keyfile=os.path.abspath("key.pem"),
    ssl_password="<YOUR_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD>",
)

# Create a map on the cluster
cities_map = client.get_map('cities').blocking()

# Clear the map
cities_map.clear()

# Add some data
cities_map.put(1, "London")
cities_map.put(2, "New York")
cities_map.put(3, "Tokyo")

# Output the data
entries = cities_map.entry_set()

for key, value in entries:
    print(f"{key} -> {value}")

# Shutdown the client connection
client.shutdown()
----

The following line returns a map proxy object for the `cities` map:

[source, python]
----
cities_map = client.get_map('cities').blocking()
----

If `cities` doesn't exist, it will be automatically created. All the clients connected to the same cluster will have access to the same map.

You may wonder why we have used `blocking()` method over the `get_map()`. This returns a version of this proxy with only blocking
(sync) method calls, which is better for getting started. For async calls, please check our https://hazelcast.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#usage[API documentation].

With these lines, the client adds data to the `cities` map. The first parameter is the key of the entry, the second one is the value.

[source, python]
----
cities_map.put(1, "London")
cities_map.put(2, "New York")
cities_map.put(3, "Tokyo")
----

Then, we get the data using the `entry_set()` method and iterate over the results.

[source, python]
----
entries = cities_map.entry_set()

for key, value in entries:
    print(f"{key} -> {value}")
----

Finally, `client.shutdown()` terminates our client and release its resources.

The output of this code is given below:

[source,bash]
----
2 -> New York
1 -> London
3 -> Tokyo
----

NOTE: Ordering of the keys is NOT enforced and results may NOT correspond to entry order.

== Add a Listener to the Map

You can add an entry listener using the `add_entry_listener()` method available on the map proxy object.
This will allow you to listen to certain events that happen in the map across the cluster.

The first argument to the `add_entry_listener()` method is `includeValue`.
This boolean parameter, if set to true, ensures the entry event contains the entry value.

The second argument to the `add_entry_listener()` method is an object that is used to define listeners.
In this example, we register listeners for the `added`, `removed` and `updated` events.

This enables your code to listen to map events of that particular map.

[source, python]
----
import hazelcast
import os

def entry_added(event):
    print(f"Entry added with key: {event.key}, value: {event.value}")

def entry_removed(event):
    print(f"Entry removed with key: {event.key}")

def entry_updated(event):
    print(f"Entry updated with key: {event.key}, old value: {event.old_value}, new value: {event.value}")

####################################

# Connect to your Hazelcast Cluster
client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
    # Cluster Name and Token
    cluster_name="<YOUR_CLUSTER_ID>",
    cloud_discovery_token="<YOUR_DISCOVERY_TOKEN>",

    # configure SSL
    ssl_enabled=True,
    ssl_cafile=os.path.abspath("ca.pem"),
    ssl_certfile=os.path.abspath("cert.pem"),
    ssl_keyfile=os.path.abspath("key.pem"),
    ssl_password="<YOUR_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD>",
)

# Create a map on the cluster
cities_map = client.get_map('cities').blocking()

# Add listeners
cities_map.add_entry_listener(
    include_value=True, added_func=entry_added, removed_func=entry_removed, updated_func=entry_updated
)

# Clear the map
cities_map.clear()

# Add some data
cities_map.set(1, "London")
cities_map.set(2, "New York")
cities_map.set(3, "Tokyo")

cities_map.remove(1)
cities_map.replace(2, "Paris")

# Output the data
entries = cities_map.entry_set()

for key, value in entries:
    print(f"{key} -> {value}")

# Shutdown the client connection
client.shutdown()
----

First, the map is cleared, which will trigger removed events if there are some entries in the map. Then, entries are added, and they are logged. After that, we remove one of the entries and update the other one. Then, we log the entries again.

The output is as follows.

[source, bash]
----
Entry added with key: 1, value: London
Entry added with key: 2, value: New York
Entry added with key: 3, value: Tokyo
Entry removed with key: 1
Entry updated with key: 2, old value: New York, new value: Paris
2 -> Paris
3 -> Tokyo
----

The value of the first entry becomes `None` since it is removed.
