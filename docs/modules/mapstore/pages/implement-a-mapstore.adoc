= Implementing a Custom MapStore
:description: pass:q[You can use the Java `MapStore` and `MapLoader` interfaces to implement a custom MapStore with your own logic, such as for database connections, loading data from an external system, and writing data back to the external system.]

== Differences Between MapLoader and MapStore

The link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/MapStore.html[`MapStore`] interface extends the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/MapLoader.html[`MapLoader`] interface. Therefore, all methods and configuration parameters of the `MapLoader` are also available on the `MapStore` interface.

If you only want to load data from external systems into a map, use the `MapLoader` interface. If you also want to save map entries to an external system, use the `MapStore` interface.

|===
|Interface| Description

|MapLoader
|The methods on the `MapLoader` interface are invoked when the application requests a value from the map. If the requested value does not exist in memory, the `MapLoader.load()` method tries to load it from the external system. Once loaded into memory, the map entry remains until it is changed, moved, or evicted.

|MapStore
|Additionally, the methods on the `MapStore` interface replicate updates made to a map to the external system. This replication can be implemented as a blocking (write-through) or non-blocking (write-behind) operation.

== Connecting to an External System

To connect to an external system, you must configure a connection to it, using either a third-party library or a JDBC driver in the `init()`  method of the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/MapLoaderLifecycleSupport.html[`MapLoaderlifeCycleSupport`] implementation.

The external system that you choose must be a centralized system that is accessible to all Hazelcast members. Persistence to a local file system is not supported.

The `init()` method initializes the MapStore. Hazelcast calls this method when the map is first created on a Hazelcast member. The MapStore can initialize the required resources such as reading a configuration file, creating a database connection, or accessing a Hazelcast instance.

TIP: By default, MapStores are loaded as soon as the first cluster member starts. If you want the cluster to wait until a certain number of members are available, you can use the `hazelcast.initial.min.cluster.size` system property. For example, if you set this value to `3`, the MapStore is not loaded until three cluster members are running.

The `destroy()` method is called during the graceful shutdown of a Hazelcast member. You can override this method to clean up the resources held by the MapStore, such as closing the database connections.

[[configuring-a-connection-using-properties]]

You can declaratively specify the database properties in your configuration file and then implement the `init()` method to receive those properties. For example, you can define the database URL and name, using the `properties` configuration element. The following is a configuration example for MongoDB:

== Populating a New Map

The first time you create a map that is configured with a MapStore, the map is empty. As a result, the Hazelcast cluster must request data from the external system. Depending on the amount of data Hazelcast needs to request, the map may take a long time to be populated with entries from the external system. The fastest way to retrieve entries from the external system is to use the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method. When you implement this method, each Hazelcast member connects to the database in parallel to request entries in its owned partitions.

The `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method can return all, some, or none of the keys. For example, you can specify a range of keys to be loaded, then rely on read-through to load the remaining keys on demand. Or, you can return a `null` value so that no data is loaded from the external system. 

[[loading-keys-incrementally]]
If the number of keys to load is large, it is more efficient to load them incrementally rather than loading them all at once. To support
incremental loading, the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method returns an `Iterable` which can be lazily populated with the results of a database query. Hazelcast iterates over the returned data and, while doing so, sends the keys to their respective owner members. The iterator that was returned from the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method may also implement the `Closeable` interface, in which case the iterator is closed when the iteration is over. This is intended for releasing resources such as closing a JDBC result set.

Hazelcast clusters populate new maps following this process:

. Initialization starts, depending on the value of the xref:configuration-guide.adoc#initial-mode[`initial-mode` configuration]. If the `initial-mode` configuration is set to `EAGER`, initialization starts on all partitions as soon as the map is created.  If the `initial-mode` property is set to `LAZY`, data is loaded when an operation tries to read an entry from the map.
. That member distributes keys to all other members in batches.
. Each member loads all values of its owned keys by calling `MapLoader.loadAll(keys)`.
. Each member puts its owned entries into the map by calling `IMap.putTransient(key,value)`.

== Using a MapStore with Write-Behind

If you xref:configuration-guide.adoc[configure] your MapStore to use the write-behind caching pattern, you can do the following:

- Apply batch updates to the external system to reduce requests to the data store.
- Edit entries in the map without writing those changes back to the external system.

=== Batch Updates

Batch operations are only allowed in write-behind pattern.  In this mode, whether your application performs a batch update/delete operation in a map or not, Hazelcast calls the
`MapStore.storeAll(map)` and `MapStore.deleteAll(collection)` methods defined in your `MapStore` class to make all operations in a single call.

When your application issues batch (for example `putAll()`) or non-batch operations (for example `put()`), all the updates in the write-behind queue are batched and batch methods of the MapStore with write-behind caching pattern are invoked; that is `storeAll()` and `deleteAll()`.

For example, if there are 50 put and 20 delete operations in the write-behind queue and it is time to flush the queue, batching results in a single invocation of `MapStore#storeAll()` for 50 put operations and a single invocation of `MapStore#deleteAll()` for 20 delete operations.

=== Editing Entries in a Map Without Writing Back to the External System

You can edit an entry in a map after it's already been written to your external system. For example, you may want to get an autogenerated ID from the data store then edit the in-memory entry for local use without writing the change back to the external system.

To edit a map entry without writing it back to the external system, implement the `PostProcessingMapStore` interface. This interface triggers an extra step of serialization, so use it only when needed.

Here is an example of post-processing:

[source,java]
----
class ProcessingStore implements MapStore<Integer, Employee>, PostProcessingMapStore {
    @Override
    public void store( Integer key, Employee employee ) {
        EmployeeId id = saveEmployee();
        employee.setId( id.getId() );
    }
}
----

NOTE: If you edit entries in combination with xref:data-structures:entry-processor.adoc[Entry Processors], edited values are be saved to in-memory backups.

[[forcing-all-keys-to-be-loaded]]
== Forcing All Keys To Be Loaded

The `MapLoader.loadAll()` method loads some or all keys into a data store in order to optimize multiple load operations. This method has two signatures. One signature loads the given keys and the other loads all keys. See the example code below.

== Setting Expiration Times on Loaded and Stored Data Entries

Entries loaded by `MapLoader` implementations do not have a set time-to-live property. Therefore, they live until evicted or explicitly removed. To enforce expiration times on the entries, you can use the `EntryLoader` and `EntryStore` interfaces.

NOTE: These interfaces extend the `MapLoader` and `MapStore` interfaces. Therefore, all methods and configuration parameters of the `MapLoader` and
`MapStore` implementations are also available on the `EntryLoader` and `EntryStore` implementations.

`EntryLoader` allows you to set time-to-live values per key before handing the values to Hazelcast. Therefore, you can store and load
key-specific time-to-live values in the external system.

Similar to `EntryLoader`, in order to store custom expiration times associated with the entries, you may use `EntryStore`. `EntryStore` allows you to retrieve associated expiration date for each entry. The expiration date is an offset from an epoch in milliseconds. Epoch is January 1, 1970 UTC which is used by `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

NOTE: Although the expiration date is expressed in milliseconds, expiration dates are rounded to the nearest lower whole second.

The following example shows you how to implement the `EntryStore` interface.

== Full Example of a MapStore

The following example shows you a complete `MapStore` implementation.

If you are using Hazelcast in client/server mode, you must add the MapStore and any dependencies to the classpath of your members.

If you use multiple threads to access shared state in a `MapStore` implementation, you need to make sure that the implementation is thread safe. Each member receives an instance of the `MapStore` implementation, which means that multiple threads can access it at the same time.

== Related Resources

To monitor MapStores for each loaded entry, use the `EntryLoadedListener` interface. See the xref:events:object-events.adoc#listening-for-map-events[Listening for Map Events section] to learn how you can catch entry-based events.

For a tutorial, see xref:tutorials:ROOT:write-through-cache-serverless-mapstore.adoc[].

== Next Steps

If you use Hazelcast in client/server mode, you must add your MapStore and any other dependencies to the classpaths of your members.

After you've created your `MapStore` implementation and it's on the classpath of your members, you need to configure one or more maps to use it. By doing so, you plug the MapStore into the lifecycle of the map. For details about configuring a MapStore, see the xref:configuration-guide.adoc[configuration guide].
