= Fault Tolerance

Hazelcast doesn't delegate its cluster management and fault
tolerance concerns to an outside system like ZooKeeper. Instead, it uses its own implementation of Chandy-Lamport distributed snapshots.
If a cluster member fails, Hazelcast will restart the job on the remaining
members, restore the state of processing from the last snapshot, and
then seamlessly continue from that point.

== Processing Guarantee is a Shared Concern

When you xref:pipelines:configuring-jobs.adoc[configure the processing guarantee for your job] as
*exactly-once* or *at-least-once*, Hazelcast uses the distributed
snapshotting feature to store all the **internal** computation state to
an `IMap`. However, this on its own isn't enough to provide the
processing guarantee because the snapshot must cover the entire
pipeline, including the external changes performed by sources and sinks.
Hazelcast requires certain guarantees from sources and sinks in a
fault-tolerant data pipeline.

When the job is restarting after a member failure, Hazelcast resets the whole
data pipeline to the state of the last snapshot. More technically,
processors can save arbitrary data to the snapshot and Hazelcast will present
that same data to the processors after a restart. Hazelcast performs such
snapshots in regular intervals. Sources can cooperate with the job in
multiple ways:

- **Replayable sources:** Seek to certain
  position and re-read events from that positions multiple times. An
  example is Apache Kafka or an IMap Journal. Such source saves the
  offset(s) to the snapshot and in case of restart it continues from the
  saved position.

- **Acknowledging sources:** Acknowledge messages after
  fully processing them. A typical example of an acknowledging source is a JMS queue. Unacknowledged
  messages are delivered again in case the job fails. Such sources need to
  do two things: (1) acknowledge messages only after a next snapshot is
  completed and (2) save message IDs for deduplication to snapshot in case
  the job fails after a snapshot is completed but before it manages to
  acknowledge the consumption. Those IDs are used to drop re-delivered
  messages after a restart.

Sinks can cooperate in different ways:

- **Transactional sinks:** such sinks write their output using a
  transaction and they commit it only after the snapshot is completed.
  Since there are multiple parallel workers writing the data, each with
  its own transaction, Hazelcast employs two-phase commit to ensure that either
  all participants commit or all roll back. An example is JMS, JDBC or
  Kafka sinks.

- **Idempotent writes:** Idempotent operation is an operation that, if
  performed multiple times, has the same effect as if performed once. An
  example is writing to an IMap: `map.put("key", "value")` has the same
  effect if you execute it once or twice. Such sinks only need to ensure
  that all in-flight operations are finished before each snapshot is
  performed. That is they need to wait for async operations to finish or
  fsync writes to files. But it's not enough to just use such a sink: you
  also need to ensure that the keys are stable. For example if you use
  random UUID for the key, it won't work, the job must produce identical
  keys after a restart. Also if you process the journal for a map, the
  journal will contain the update event multiple times.

== Distributed Snapshot

The technique Hazelcast uses to achieve fault tolerance is called a
“distributed snapshot”, described in a link:http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/chandy.pdf[paper by Chandy and Lamport]. At regular
intervals, Hazelcast raises a global flag that says "it’s time for another
snapshot". All processors belonging to source vertices observe the flag,
save their state, emit a barrier item to the downstream processors and
resume processing.

As the barrier item reaches a processor, it stops what it’s doing and
saves its state to the snapshot storage. Once complete, it forwards the
barrier item to its downstream processors and resumes. The same story
repeats in the downstream processors, eventually reaching the sink
processors. When they complete, the snapshot is done.

This is the basic story, but due to parallelism, in most cases a
processor receives data from more than one upstream processor. It will
receive the barrier item from each of them at separate times, but it
must start taking a snapshot at a single point in time. There are two
approaches it can take, as explained below.

=== Exactly-Once

With exactly-once configured, as soon as the processor gets a barrier
item in any input stream (from any upstream processor), it must stop
consuming it until it gets the same barrier item in all the streams:

. Stream X is at the barrier, Y not yet. The processor must not accept
   any more X items.
+
image:exactly-once-1.png[Exactly-once processing: received one of two barrier items]

. At the barrier in both streams, taking a snapshot.
+
image:exactly-once-2.png[Exactly-once processing: received both barrier items]

. Snapshot done, barrier forwarded. Processor resumes consuming all
   streams.
+
image:exactly-once-3.png[Exactly-once processing: forwarding the barrier]

=== At-Least-Once

With at-least-once configured, the processor can keep consuming all the
streams until it gets all the barriers, at which point it stops to take
the snapshot:

. Stream X is at the barrier, Y not yet. Carry on consuming all streams.
+
image:at-least-once-1.png[At-Least-once processing: received one barrier]

. At the barrier in both streams, already consumed x1 and x2. Taking a snapshot.
+
image:at-least-once-2.png[At-Least-once processing: received both barriers]

. Snapshot done, barrier forwarded.
+
image:at-least-once-3.png[At-Least-once processing: forward the barrier]

Even though `x1` and `x2` occur after the barrier, the processor
consumed and processed them before processing the barrier, updating its
state accordingly. If the computation job stops and restarts, this state
will be restored from the snapshot and then the source will replay `x1`
and `x2`. The processor will think it got two new items.

== Data Safety

=== In-Memory Snapshot Storage

Hazelcast backs up the state of jobs to its own xref:data-structures:map.adoc[map] objects. Map is a replicated
in-memory data structure, storing each key-value pair on a configurable
number of cluster members. By default it makes a single backup copy,
resulting in a system that tolerates the failure of a single member at a
time. The cluster recovers its safety level by re-establishing all the
missing backups, and when this is done, another node can fail without
data loss. You can set the backup count in the configuration, for
example:

```yaml
hazelcast:
  jet:
    instance:
      backup-count: 2
```

If multiple members fail simultaneously, some data from the backing
maps can be lost. Hazelcast detects this by counting the entries in the
snapshot map and it won't run a job with missing data.

== Split-Brain Protection

There is a special kind of cluster failure, popularly called the "Split
Brain". It occurs due to a complex network failure (a network
*partition*) where the graph of live connections among cluster members
falls apart into two islands. In each island it seems like all the other
members failed, so the remaining cluster should self-heal and continue
working. Now you have two Hazelcast clusters working in parallel, each running
all the jobs on all the data.

Hazelcast offers a mechanism to mitigate this risk: split-brain
protection. It works by ensuring that a job can be restarted only in a
cluster whose size is more than half of what it ever was. Enable
split-brain protection like this:

```java
jobConfig.setSplitBrainProtection(true);
```

NOTE: Make sure that you resolve the split-brain condition before introducing new members to the cluster. Otherwise, both sub-clusters may grow to more than half of the previous size, circumventing split-brain protection.

=== Disk Snapshot Storage

In-memory snapshot storage doesn’t cover the case when the entire
cluster must shut down. To save snapshots to disk, see xref:storage:persistence.adoc[].
