= IdentifiedDataSerializable

For a faster serialization of objects, avoiding reflection and long class names,
Hazelcast recommends you to implement `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.IdentifiedDataSerializable`.

`IdentifiedDataSerializable` uses a factory to create a class instance (with reflection) and
it is fast during deserialization, which requires new instance creations.

== getClassId and getFactoryId Methods

`IdentifiedDataSerializable` extends xref:implementing-dataserializable.adoc[`DataSerializable`] and introduces the following methods:

* `int getClassId();`
* `int getFactoryId();`

`IdentifiedDataSerializable` uses `getClassId()` instead of class name and it uses
`getFactoryId()` to load the class when given the id. To complete the implementation,
you should also implement  `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.DataSerializableFactory` and
register it into `SerializationConfig`, which can be accessed from `Config.getSerializationConfig()`.
Factory's responsibility is to return an instance of the right `IdentifiedDataSerializable` object, given the id.
This is currently the most efficient way of Serialization that Hazelcast supports off the shelf.

== Implementing IdentifiedDataSerializable

Let's take a look at the following example code and configuration to see `IdentifiedDataSerializable` in action.

[source,java]
----
public class Employee
    implements IdentifiedDataSerializable {

    private String surname;

    public Employee() {}

    public Employee( String surname ) {
        this.surname = surname;
    }

    @Override
    public void readData( ObjectDataInput in )
      throws IOException {
        this.surname = in.readString();
    }

    @Override
    public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out )
      throws IOException {
        out.writeString( surname );
    }

    @Override
    public int getFactoryId() {
        return EmployeeDataSerializableFactory.FACTORY_ID;
    }

    @Override
    public int getClassId() {
        return EmployeeDataSerializableFactory.EMPLOYEE_TYPE;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format( "Employee(surname=%s)", surname );
    }
}
----

The methods `getClassId` and `getFactoryId` return a unique positive number within
the `EmployeeDataSerializableFactory`.
Now, let's create an instance of this `EmployeeDataSerializableFactory`.

[source,java]
----
public class EmployeeDataSerializableFactory
    implements DataSerializableFactory{

    public static final int FACTORY_ID = 1;

    public static final int EMPLOYEE_TYPE = 1;

    @Override
    public IdentifiedDataSerializable create(int typeId) {
        if ( typeId == EMPLOYEE_TYPE ) {
            return new Employee();
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
}
----

The only method you should implement is `create`, as seen in the above example.
It is recommended that you use a `switch-case` statement instead of
multiple `if-else` blocks if you have a lot of subclasses.
Hazelcast throws an exception if null is returned for `typeId`.

[[register]]
== Registering EmployeeDataSerializableFactory

As the last step, you need to register `EmployeeDataSerializableFactory` declaratively
(declare in the configuration file `hazelcast.xml/yaml`) as shown below.
Note that `factory-id` has the same value of `FACTORY_ID` in the above code.
This is crucial to enable Hazelcast to find the correct factory.

== Hazelcast Clients

When using a client/server deployment, you also need to register the implemented factory on
the client side. For a Java client, the process is the same as described above to be performed
in the client configuration, e.g., `hazelcast-client.xml/yaml`.
