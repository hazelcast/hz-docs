[[Mongo]]
=== Example MongoDB Data Connection

This example configuration shows data connections to two MongoDB databases. 

As in the example, you can supply authentication credentials to a MongoDB instance as part of the connection string, or separately.

SQL::

Data connections created in SQL behave differently from those defined in members' configuration files or in Java.

- To retain SQL-defined data connections after a cluster restart, you must enable xref:storage:configuring-persistence.adoc#sql[SQL metadata persistence]. This feature is available in the {enterprise-product-name}.
- You can create or drop a data connection using SQL commands. To update a data connection, you need to drop and then recreate it.

|===
| Property | Default value | Description | When to use

|`connectionString`
|
| The connection string used to connect to given MongoDB instance. More in https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/[Mongo documentation].
| Can be omitted if you prefer to provide `host`,

| `databaseName`
|
| Name of the database that can be accessed via this connection. If omitted, user will have access to all databases
available to given Mongo user.
| If you want to restrict usage of this Data Connection to a particular database. Mandatory if you want to use
this Data Connection with GenericMapStore.

| `username`
|
| Username used to authenticate to Mongo.
| If you want to avoid putting credentials in connection string, you can use this dedicated option.

| `password`
|
| Password used to authenticate to Mongo.
| If you want to avoid putting credentials in connection string, you can use this dedicated option.

| `authDb`
| `admin`
| Authentication database - the database that holds user's data. It is *not* the same as the `databaseName` option,
both options can specify other databases - one to authenticate, other to actually read.
| If you want to use `username` and `password` options, the `authDb` option is the way to configure authentication database
name (which can be contained in `connectionString`).

| `host`
| Host to which Hazelcast will connect. Exclusive with `connectionString`.
| If you want to use `username` and `password` options, the `host` option is the way to configure host name.
|

| `connectionPoolMinSize`
| 10
| Sets the minimum size of MongoClient's internal connection pool.
| If you want to control connection pool size

| `connectionPoolMaxSize`
| 10
| Sets the maximum size of MongoClient's internal connection pool.
| If you want to control connection pool size

| `enableSsl`
|
| Enables SSL support for Mongo client. Default value is `false`.
|

| `invalidHostNameAllowed`
|
| Allows invalid hostnames in SSL. Default value is `false`. See https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/reference/options/#std-option-mongosh.--tlsAllowInvalidHostnames[Mongo docs] for more info.
|

| `keyStore`
|
| Location of the key store, file must be present on all members.
|

| `keyStoreType`
|
| Type of the used key store. Defaults to system default.
|

| `keyStorePassword`
|
| Password to the key store.
|

| `trustStore`
|
| Location of the trust store, file must be present on all members.
|

| `trustStoreType`
|
| Type of the used trust store. Defaults to system default.
|

| `trustStorePassword`
|
| Password to the trust store.
