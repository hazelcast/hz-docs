= Start a Local Cluster from Binary
:description: This tutorial introduces you to Hazelcast in a client/server topology. At the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to start a cluster from the binary distribution, store data in memory, visualize your data and more.

|===

== Step 1. Configure the Name of the Cluster

Cluster configuration is an important step in creating a Hazelcast cluster. In this step, you learn how to configure a cluster by customizing its name.

. Open the `hazelcast.xml` file in the `hazelcast-{full-version}/config` directory.

. Change the value of the `hazelcast.cluster-name` field to `hello-world`.
+
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <cluster-name>hello-world</cluster-name>
</hazelcast>
----

. Save and exit the file.

. Open the `hazelcast-client.xml` file in the `hazelcast-{full-version}/config` directory.

. Add the same `cluster-name` configuration to the `hazelcast-client` element.
+
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
  <cluster-name>hello-world</cluster-name>
</hazelcast-client>
----

. Save and exit the file.

== Step 2. Start a Local Member

Hazelcast clusters consist of servers called _members_. These members communicate with each other to form a distributed network. It's these servers that store and process your data in memory.

In this step, you use the cluster management scripts to start a single-member cluster and check its status.

. Start a member.

====
+
You should see your cluster's name in the console:
+
image:platform-cluster-name.png[Platform console displays the cluster name 'hello-world']

. Open a new terminal window and use the `cluster` command to check the state of your member.
+
The `--config` flag tells the CLI client to connect to the cluster, using the configuration in the `hazelcast-client.xml` file.

----
+
1. The state of the cluster. An active cluster is one that is operating without restrictions.
2. The number of members in the cluster.
3. The internal IP address and UUID of the member.

== Step 3. Write Data to Memory

Hazelcast has lots of distributed data structures available for writing data to memory in your cluster. One of the most popular ways of writing data to memory is to use a distributed map. Maps store key/value pairs called entries, which are replicated and distributed across a cluster.

== Step 5. Set up Management Center

Management Center is a user interface for managing and monitoring your cluster.

In this step, you start a local instance of Management Center and use it to view your cluster's statistics.

. Start Management Center.

----
management-center/bin/start.sh
----
--
Windows:: 
+
--
[source,shell]
----
management-center/bin/start.bat
----
--
====

. In a web browser, go to localhost:8080 and enable dev mode.
+
image:mc-dev-mode.png[Enabling dev mode in Management center]

. Enter your cluster's name (`hello-world`) and your internal IP address.
+
You should see that you cluster is in an active state and has a single member. An active cluster is one that is operating without restrictions. To learn more about cluster states, see xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc#cluster-states[Cluster States].
+
image:mc-active-cluster.png[An active cluster in Management Center]

. Click *View Cluster* and go to *Clients*.
+
You should see that two clients are connected to your cluster member: Management Center and the Hazelcast client that you used to write data to a map.

. Go to *Storage* > *Maps*.
+
You should see that your cluster has a map called `my-distributed-map` with three entries (keys and values). You'll also see the total amount of memory that those entries are taking up in your cluster.
+
image:mc-distributed-map.png[Map metrics in Management Center]
+
For now, the backup memory is 0 because you don't have any other members in your cluster on which to back up your map entries.

To back up your map, you need to scale up your cluster.

== Step 6. Scale your Cluster

If your cluster starts to run out of memory, you can add more members to it and they will distribute their data across the new members.

Your cluster will even create a copy of any map entries and distribute them across other members of the cluster. This way, your data is secure in case of a single member failure.

In this step, you add two more members to your cluster.

. Open a new terminal and run the `start` script to start another member.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd hazelcast-{full-version}
bin/hz-start
----

. Repeat the previous step to start another member.
+
You should see that your members find and connect to each other automatically to form your `hello-world` cluster. You can learn more about how members do this in xref:clusters:discovery-mechanisms.adoc[].
+
image:three-member-cluster.png[Console message displays three members connected to the same cluster]
+
NOTE: Running more than one member on a single host is useful for testing Hazelcast, but it's not suitable for production.

. Back in Management Center, go to *Storage* > *Maps* again.
+
You should see that the backup memory is the same as the entry memory, meaning that all your map entries have now been copied and distributed among the other two cluster members.

. To see how your map entries are distributed among members in your cluster, click *my-distributed-map*.
+
image:backup-count.png[Entries and their backups are distributed evenly across the other members]
+
You should see that entries and their backups are distributed evenly across each member. This process is called partitioning.

== Step 7. Simulate a Member Failure

If a member fails for any reason, the other cluster members use their backups to repartition the data across the remaining cluster members.

In the terminal of one of your running members, press kbd:[Ctrl+C] to shut down the member.

You should the `Hazelcast Shutdown is completed` message in the console.

In Management Center, you should also see that the amount of entry memory and backup memory has not changed. All your map entries are still in memory despite a member being shut down. The remaining Hazelcast members have repartitioned the data.
