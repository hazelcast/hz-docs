:description: Hazelcast provides two types of support: one for {open-source-product-name} users and one for {enterprise-product-name} customers.

{description}

== Community support

Community support is available to every Hazelcast user. You can use the following channels to get community support:

* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast[Hazelcast GitHub] (for reporting issues through our GitHub repository)
* https://slack.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast Community Slack^].

== Customer support

Customer support is available to {enterprise-product-name} customers.
See https://hazelcast.com/services/support/?utm_source=docs-website[hazelcast.com^] for the support options.

A support subscription from Hazelcast provides rapid response times to technical
support inquiries, access to critical software patches, and other services which
will help you achieve increased productivity and quality. Learn more about Hazelcast support subscriptions:

The following section explains what information to include and how to submit a support ticket.

=== Before submitting a ticket

To help Hazelcast Support diagnose and resolve issues quickly, provide as much accurate and complete information as possible. This section explains how to prepare your environment and what information and logs to collect.

==== Hazelcast configuration

Much of the information required to understand a Hazelcast deployment is contained in the configuration, as well as the number of members that are running, and details of the servers or virtualized environments they're running on.

The Hazelcast configuration is supplied to a Hazelcast instance on startup in one of two ways:

1. xref:configuration:configuring-declaratively[Declaratively] by supplying the Hazelcast member with an XML or YAML file; or
2. xref:configuration:configuring-programmatically[Programmatically] by starting an embedded instance of Hazelcast with a com.hazelcast.config.Config object

You can provide the Hazelcast configuration to the Support team, either as an XML or YAML file, or the code blocks making up the Config object. Alternatively, you can obtain the configuration from each member in the cluster by visiting their member pages in the Members section of Management Center.

==== Hazelcast client configuration

The Hazelcast Clients also have their own configurations that determine their behavior and the features they utilize. Some clients, such as Java, .NET, and Node.js, can be configured declaratively or programmatically, while others, such as Go, Python, and C++, can only be configured programatically. 

When providing the Hazelcast Client configuration, the following can be provided for each client:

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
|Client type |Declarative |Programmatic

|Java
|XML, YAML
|Yes

|.NET
|XML
|Yes

|Node.js
|JSON
|Yes

|Go

|Yes

|Python

==== Hazelcast logs

The Hazelcast logs contain useful information when debugging an issue in a Hazelcast cluster. Each member has its own Hazelcast log, which typically includes:

- Metrics about the Hazelcast member, such as HealthMonitor output
- Log messages indicating when Hazelcast clients connect and disconnect from the member
- Details on slow operations
- Stack traces
- Other log messages regarding cluster health and performance

We recommend you configure Hazelcast to use log4j, log4j2 or logback via slf4j. For more information about how to do this, see xref:maintain-cluster:logging.adoc[].  

TIP: Be sure to review the configuration of your logging framework to ensure Hazelcast logs are being kept for an appropriate amount of time, and that the correct log level is set (INFO by default.)

==== Hazelcast diagnostics logging

Hazelcast provides diagnostic logging capabilities that help with troubleshooting and monitoring.

An extended set of diagnostics plugins is provided for both Hazelcast members and clients that can capture:

- Information about the Hazelcast build version
- Properties related to the Operating System, JVM, and Hazelcast
- Properties related to the Hazelcast configuration
- Comprehensive metrics
- Details about slow operations
- Details about the invocations run on the member
- State of the Hazelcast cluster
- A log of system events, such as cluster version changes, member additions and removals, etc.
- Map store metrics
- Member-to-member health check information
- Details about the type and volume of operations run on the member
- WAN Replication diagnostic information

The Hazelcast configuration provides settings for the rotation and retention of these diagnostic log files. For more information about the diagnostic plugins and how to configure them, see xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#logging[Diagnostics].

TIP: Do not truncate diagnostics logs. If you must truncate a log, ensure the startup section—containing environment and system details—is included.

==== JVM garbage collection logs

The JVM's garbage collection logs are often valuable in diagnosing performance problems in Hazelcast. Garbage collection (GC) logging is not enabled by default. We recommend you enable GC logging in production environments for performance analysis.

This section describes the configuration parameters to enable JVM garbage collection logging, along with parameters for rotation and retention. 

In Java 8 and below, the output file path is set with the -Xloggc parameter; in Java 9 and above, with the file= parameter.

*Java 8 and below:*
----
-verbose:gc
-Xloggc:gc.log
-XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=10
-XX:GCLogFileSize=10M
-XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation
-XX:+PrintGCDetails
-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps
-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime
----

*Java 9 and above:*
----
-Xlog:safepoint,gc+age=debug,gc*=debug:file=gc.log:uptime,level,tags:filesize=10m,filecount=10
----

Next, prepare the following information before submitting a ticket:

- Clear description of the issue. Summarize the problem and include relevant context.
- Steps to reproduce. Include detailed steps. If the issue cannot be reproduced, document the sequence of events leading up to the incident.
- Error messages and screenshots. Include stack traces, exceptions, UI errors, or any visual evidence.
- Detailed timeline. Record what happened and when, including the exact incident date and time.

=== Complete the support ticket

Create a ticket using the https://support.hazelcast.com/s/?utm_source=docs-website[Hazelcast Support Portal] and include the following sections:

1. Title and description
+
Write a clear, concise title summarising the problem. In the description, provide:
+
•	What you observed
•	What you expected
•	When the issue occurred
•	Whether the issue is ongoing, intermittent, or resolved
+
2. Steps to reproduce
+
Document detailed steps so Support can attempt to reproduce the issue.
+
3. Optional reproducible test case
+
If available, include a minimal project or code sample that demonstrates the problem. Engineering may request this later if required.
+
4. Use case details
+
Explain how you use Hazelcast, including:
+
•	Data structures involved
•	Client types
•	Cluster size
•	Deployment environment (cloud, on-prem, containerised)
•	Any recent changes (upgrades, configuration changes, scaling events)
+
This information helps Support identify which components may be affected.

==== Set the ticket severity

Choose the correct severity to ensure the issue is routed appropriately.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Severity |Description

|Level 1
|Current production outage with no workaround

|Level 2
|Current production outage with a temporary workaround (for example, serving static content)

|Level 3
|Development issues, low-impact production issues, or analysis of an incident that has already ended

|Level 4
|General questions, enhancement requests, or other non-critical issues
|===

After submitting your ticket, respond promptly to any follow-up questions or requests for additional data as timely communication helps accelerate investigation and resolution.

==== Summary

To ensure the fastest possible resolution:

•	Collect detailed observations before submitting a ticket
•	Provide complete, untruncated logs and diagnostics
•	Include Hazelcast and client configuration files
•	Select the correct severity level
•	Keep diagnostics and logging enabled in all environments
•	Communicate promptly with Hazelcast Support
