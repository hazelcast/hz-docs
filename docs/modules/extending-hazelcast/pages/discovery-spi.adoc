= Discovery SPI

By default, Hazelcast is bundled with multiple ways to define and find other members in the same network.
Commonly used, especially with development, is the Multicast discovery.
This sends out a multicast request to a network segment and awaits other members to
answer with their IP addresses. In addition, Hazelcast supports a number of built-in discovery strategies described in
the xref:clusters:discovery-mechanisms.adoc[Discovery Mechanisms] section.

Since there is an ever-growing number of public and private cloud environments,
as well as numerous Service Discovery systems in the wild,
Hazelcast provides cloud or service discovery vendors with the option to
implement their own discovery strategy.

Over the course of this section, we will build a simple
discovery strategy based on the `/etc/hosts` file.

== Discovery SPI Interfaces and Classes

The Hazelcast Discovery SPI (Member Discovery Extensions) consists of
multiple interfaces and abstract classes. In the following subsections,
we will have a quick look at all them and shortly introduce the idea and usage behind them.
The example will follow in the next section, <<discovery-strategy, Discovery Strategy>>.

=== DiscoveryStrategy: Implement

The `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategy` interface is
the main entry point for vendors to implement their corresponding member discovery strategies.
Its main purpose is to return discovered members on request.
The `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategy` interface also offers
light lifecycle capabilities for setup and teardown logic (for example, opening or closing sockets or REST API clients).

``DiscoveryStrategy``s can also do automatic registration / de-registration on
service discovery systems if necessary.
You can use the provided `DiscoveryNode` that is passed to
the factory method to retrieve local addresses and ports, as well as metadata.

=== AbstractDiscoveryStrategy: Abstract Class

The `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.AbstractDiscoveryStrategy` is a convenience abstract class meant to
ease the implementation of strategies. It basically provides additional support for
reading / resolving configuration properties and empty implementations of lifecycle methods if unnecessary.

=== DiscoveryStrategyFactory: Factory Contract

The `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategyFactory` interface describes
the factory contract that creates a certain `DiscoveryStrategy`.
`DiscoveryStrategyFactory` s are registered automatically at startup of
a Hazelcast member or client whenever they are found in the classpath.
For automatic discovery, factories need to announce themselves as
SPI services using a resource file according to the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html[Java Service Provider Interface^].
The service registration file must be part of the JAR file, located under
`META-INF/services/com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategyFactory`, and consist of
a line with the full canonical class name of the `DiscoveryStrategy` per provided strategy implementation.

=== DiscoveryNode: Describe a Member

The `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryNode` abstract class describes a member in the Discovery SPI.
It is used for multiple purposes, since it will be returned from strategies for discovered members.
It is also passed to ``DiscoveryStrategyFactory``s factory method to define
the local member itself if created on a Hazelcast member; on Hazelcast clients, null is passed.

=== SimpleDiscoveryNode: Default DiscoveryNode

`com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.SimpleDiscoveryNode` is a default implementation of the `DiscoveryNode`.
It is meant for convenience use of the Discovery SPI and can be returned from
vendor implementations if no special needs are required.

=== NodeFilter: Filter Members

You can configure `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.NodeFilter` before startup and
you can implement logic to do additional filtering of members.
This might be necessary if query languages for discovery strategies are not
expressive enough to describe members or to overcome inefficiencies of strategy implementations.

NOTE: The `DiscoveryStrategy` vendor does not need to take possibly configured filters into account
as their use is transparent to the strategies.

=== DiscoveryService: Support In Integrator Systems

A `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.integration.DiscoveryService` is part of the integration domain.
`DiscoveryStrategy` vendors do not need to implement `DiscoveryService` because
it is meant to support the Discovery SPI in situations where vendors integrate Hazelcast into
their own systems or frameworks. Certain needs might be necessary as part of the classloading or
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html[Java Service Provider Interface^] lookup.

=== DiscoveryServiceProvider: Provide a DiscoveryService

Use the `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.integration.DiscoveryServiceProvider` to provide
a `DiscoveryService` to the Hazelcast discovery subsystem. Configure the provider with the Hazelcast configuration API.

=== DiscoveryServiceSettings: Configure DiscoveryService

A `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.integration.DiscoveryServiceSettings` instance is passed to
the `DiscoveryServiceProvider` at creation time to configure the `DiscoveryService`.

=== DiscoveryMode: Member or Client

The `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.integration.DiscoveryMode` enum tells if
a created `DiscoveryService` is running on a Hazelcast member or client to change the behavior accordingly.

== Discovery Strategy

This subsection walks through the implementation of a simple `DiscoveryStrategy` and its necessary setup.

=== Discovery Strategy Example

The example strategy uses the local `/etc/hosts` (and on Windows it uses
the equivalent to the `*nix` hosts file named `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`) to
lookup IP addresses of different hosts. The strategy implementation expects hosts to be configured with
hostname subgroups under the same domain. So far to theory, let's get into it.

The full example's source code can be found https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples[here^].

=== Configuring Site Domain

As a first step we do some basic configuration setup. We want the user to be able to
configure the site domain for the discovery inside the hosts file, therefore we define
a configuration property called `site-domain`. The configuration is not optional:
you need to configure it before the creation of the `HazelcastInstance`, either
via Hazelcast's declarative or programmatic configuration.

It is recommended that you keep all defined properties in a separate configuration class as
public constants (`public static final`) with sufficient documentation.
This allows users to easily look up possible configuration values.

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/extendinghazelcast/HostsDiscoveryConfiguration.java[tag=hdc]
----

An additional `ValueValidator` could be passed to the definition to make sure
the configured value looks like a domain or has a special format.

=== Creating Discovery

As the second step we create the very simple `DiscoveryStrategyFactory` implementation class.
To keep things clear we are going to name the discovery strategy after its purpose:
looking into the hosts file.

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/extendinghazelcast/HostsDiscoveryStrategyFactory.java[tag=hdsf]
----

This factory now defines properties known to the discovery strategy implementation and
provides a clean way to instantiate it. While creating the `HostsDiscoveryStrategy` we ignore
the passed `DiscoveryNode` since this strategy does not support automatic registration of new members.
In cases where the strategy does not support registration, the environment has to handle this in some provided way.

NOTE: Remember that, when created on a Hazelcast client, the provided `DiscoveryNode` is null, as there is no
local member in existence.

Next, we register the `DiscoveryStrategyFactory` to make Hazelcast pick it up automatically at startup.
As described earlier, this is done according to the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html[Java Service Provider Interface^] specification.
The filename is the name of the interface itself. Therefore, we create a new resource file called
`com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategyFactory` and place it under `META-INF/services`.
The content is the full canonical class name of our factory implementation.

```
com.hazelcast.examples.spi.discovery.HostsDiscoveryStrategyFactory
```

If our JAR file contains multiple factories, each consecutive line can define another
full canonical `DiscoveryStrategyFactory` implementation class name.

=== Implementing Discovery Strategy

Now comes the interesting part. We are going to implement the discovery itself.
The previous parts we did are normally pretty similar for all strategies aside from the configuration properties itself.
However, implementing the discovery heavily depends on the way the strategy has to come up with
IP addresses of other Hazelcast members.

=== Extending The `AbstractDiscoveryStrategy`

For ease of implementation, we back our implementation by extending the `AbstractDiscoveryStrategy` and
only implementing the absolute minimum ourselves.

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/extendinghazelcast/HostsDiscoveryStrategy.java[tag=hds]
----

=== Overriding Discovery Configuration

So far our implementation retrieves the configuration property for the `site-domain`.
Our implementation offers the option to override the value from the configuration
(declarative or programmatic) right from the system environment or JVM properties.
That can be useful when the `hazelcast.xml` defines a setup for a developer system (like `cluster.local`) and
operations wants to override it for the real deployment.
By providing a prefix (in this case `discovery.hosts`) we created an
external property named `discovery.hosts.site-domain` which can be set as an
environment variable or passed as a JVM property from the startup script.

The lookup priority is explained in the following list, priority is from top to bottom:

* JVM properties (or under the `properties` element in `hazelcast.xml`)
* System environment
* Configuration properties

=== Implementing Lookup

Since we have the value for our property now, we can implement the actual lookup and
mapping as already prepared in the `discoverNodes` method.
The following part is very specific to this special discovery strategy;
for completeness we are showing it anyway.

[source,java]
----
private static final String HOSTS_NIX = "/etc/hosts";
private static final String HOSTS_WINDOWS =
                   "%SystemRoot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts";

private List<String> filterHosts() {
    String os = System.getProperty( "os.name" );

    String hostsPath;
    if ( os.contains( "Windows" ) ) {
        hostsPath = HOSTS_WINDOWS;
    } else {
    hostsPath = HOSTS_NIX;
    }

    File hosts = new File( hostsPath );

    // Read all lines
    List<String> lines = readLines( hosts );

    List<String> assignments = new ArrayList<String>();
    for ( String line : lines ) {
        // Example:
        // 192.168.0.1   host1.cluster.local
        if ( matchesDomain( line ) ) {
            assignments.add( line );
        }
    }
    return assignments;
}
----

=== Mapping to DiscoveryNode

After we have collected the address assignments configured in the hosts file,
we can go to the final step and map those to the ``DiscoveryNode``s to return
them from our strategy.

[source,java]
----
private Iterable<DiscoveryNode> mapToDiscoveryNodes( List<String> assignments ) {
  Collection<DiscoveryNode> discoveredNodes = new ArrayList<DiscoveryNode>();

    for ( String assignment : assignments ) {
        String address = sliceAddress( assignment );
        String hostname = sliceHostname( assignment );

        Map<String, Object> attributes =
          Collections.singletonMap( "hostname", hostname );

        InetAddress inetAddress = mapToInetAddress( address );
        Address addr = new Address( inetAddress, NetworkConfig.DEFAULT_PORT );

        discoveredNodes.add( new SimpleDiscoveryNode( addr, attributes ) );
    }
    return discoveredNodes;
}
----

With that mapping, we now have a full discovery, executed whenever Hazelcast asks for IPs.
So why don't we read them in once and cache them?
The answer is simple: it might happen that members go down or come up over time.
Since we expect the hosts file to be injected into the running container,
it also might change over time. We want to get the latest available
members, therefore we read the file on request.

=== Configuring DiscoveryStrategy

To actually use the new `DiscoveryStrategy` implementation we need to
configure it like in the following example:

== DiscoveryService (Framework integration)

Since the `DiscoveryStrategy` is meant for cloud vendors or implementors
of service discovery systems, the `DiscoveryService` is meant for integrators.
In this case, integrators mean people integrating Hazelcast into their own systems or frameworks.
In those situations, there may be special requirements on
how to lookup framework services like the discovery strategies or similar services.
Integrators can extend or implement their own `DiscoveryService` and
`DiscoveryServiceProvider` and inject them using the
`com.hazelcast.config.DiscoveryConfig` configuration API prior to instantiating the `HazelcastInstance`.
In any case, integrators might have to remember that a `DiscoveryService` might have to change
behavior based on the runtime environment (Hazelcast member or client) and
then the `DiscoveryServiceSettings` should provide information about the started `HazelcastInstance`.

Since the implementation heavily depends on one's needs,
there is no reason to provide an example of how to implement your own `DiscoveryService`.
However, Hazelcast provides a default implementation which can be a good example to get started.
This default implementation is `com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.impl.DefaultDiscoveryService`.
