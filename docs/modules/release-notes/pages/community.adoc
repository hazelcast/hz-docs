== 5.6.0

**Release date**: 2024-10-30

=== Security
==== CVEs and security issues already fixed in {enterprise-product-name} 5.5.7, released 2025-07-22:

* **Security Fix for CVE-2025-30065 – Remote code execution via parquet-avro in hazelcast-sql module:** Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30065[CVE-2025-30065], a critical vulnerability in the `org.apache.parquet:parquet-avro:1.14.1` transitive dependency used by the hazelcast-sql module. The issue allows remote code execution via malicious Avro schema deserialization when reading Avro-encoded Parquet files.

==== CVEs and security issues already fixed in {enterprise-product-name} 5.5.6, released 2025-05-19:

* **Updated exception handling for non-existent JAAS classes**: Resolved an issue where specifying a non-existent class for JAAS configuration did not result in an appropriate exception being logged. Previously, this caused a lack of visibility into configuration errors, making it harder to diagnose issues. The fix ensures that when a non-existent class is specified for JAAS, an `InvalidConfigurationException` is properly logged in the server logs, replacing the incorrect reference to `ClassNotFoundException`.
* **Security Fix for CVE-2025-31651 - Improper neutralization of escape, meta, or control sequences vulnerability in Apache Tomcat**: We have resolved
 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31651[CVE-2025-31651], a critical vulnerability in Apache Tomcat where for a subset of unlikely rewrite rule configurations, it was possible for a specially crafted request to bypass some rewrite rules.
* **Security Fix for CVE-2025-24813 - Remote code execution and/or information disclosure and/or malicious content added to uploaded files via write enabled Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat**: We have resolved
 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24813[CVE-2025-24813], a critical vulnerability in Apache Tomcat where in some circumstances a malicious user was able to view security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files. 
* **Security Fix for CVE-2025-31650 - Improper input validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat**: We have resolved
 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31650[CVE-2025-31650], a high vulnerability in Apache Tomcat where incorrect error handling for some invalid HTTP priority headers resulted in incomplete clean-up of the failed request which created a memory leak. 
* **Security Fix for CVE-2024-38286 - Allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability in Apache Tomcat**: We have resolved
 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38286[CVE-2024-38286], a high vulnerability in Apache Tomcat where under certain configurations on any platform, it allows an attacker to cause an OutOfMemoryError by abusing the TLS handshake process.

==== CVEs and security issues already fixed in {enterprise-product-name} 5.5.5, released 2025-03-19:

* **Security Fix for CVE-2024-47561**: We have resolved https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r7pg-v2c8-mfg3[CVE-2024-47561], a critical vulnerability in the Apache Avro Java SDK (versions 1.11.3 and earlier) that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code through maliciously crafted Avro schemas. 

==== CVEs and security issues already fixed in {enterprise-product-name} 5.5.3, released 2024-10-17:

* **Security Fix for CVE-2023-45676**: We have resolved https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gcg6-xv4f-f749[CVE-2023-45676], a dependency vulnerability related to improper authorization checks in certain scenarios. This issue could potentially allow attackers to bypass expected permission restrictions.
