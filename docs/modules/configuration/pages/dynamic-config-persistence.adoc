= Configuring Dynamic Configuration
:description: You can configure members to keep dynamic configuration changes in memory or persist them to a YAML or XML configuration file.

== Production Checklist

Before you start configuring members to persist dynamic configuration changes, consider the following checklist:

- [ ] Does your cluster have enough available disk space, especially if you want to <<backup, create backups of the configuration file>>?
- [ ] Does your cluster have read/write permissions for the configuration file? All members must have write permissions to the configuration file.
- [ ] Is your cluster free of configuration conflicts? Hazelcast does not support persistence in clusters that have conflicting configuration files.
- [ ] Are you using a <<glossary, root configuration file>> to start members? Dynamic configuration changes are persisted to the root configuration file, so you need to configure and start Hazelcast with that file.

NOTE: Running clusters must be xref:maintain-cluster:restart-cluster.adoc[restarted] before any configuration changes take effect.

== Development Checklist

Before you start configuring members to persist dynamic configuration changes, consider the following checklist:

- [ ] Do you start multiple members on a single device? Each member should have a unique root configuration file.

== Kubernetes Checklist

If you use Kubernetes, *do not configure persistence for dynamic configuration*. Dynamic configuration changes are persisted to the root configuration file, not the ConfigMap.

See xref:dynamic-config.adoc#persistence[Persisting Dynamic Configuration in Kubernetes].

== Enabling Persistence
[.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*

By default, persistence for dynamic configuration changes is disabled on all clusters. To start persisting changes on disk, you must first enable the feature on the member.

To enable persistence for dynamic configuration changes, set the `persistence-enabled` option to `true.

[[backup]]
== Creating Backups of the Configuration File
[.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*

By default, Hazelcast keeps 5 backups of the configuration file in the member's startup directory.

To change the number of backups, configure the `backup-count` option.  To change the directory in which to store the backups, configure the <<dynamic-configuration-backup-dir,`backup-dir`>> option.

The filenames of backups are in the following format, which includes the date and time when they were created followed by the `.backup` extension: `yyyy-MM-dd--HH-mm-ss-SSS.backup`. For example, `2022-01-31--13-23-44-699.backup`.

WARNING: If the backup directory contains existing files with the `.backup` extension or if time is shifted while the member is running, the order of backups can be corrupted.

== Configuration Options

Use the following configuration options to configure dynamic configuration for a cluster.

.Configuration options for dynamic configuration
[cols="20%m,80%a"]
|===
| Option|Description

|dynamic-configuration
| Root configuration

a| `persistence-enabled` [.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*
| Whether changes made in dynamic configuration are persisted to a configuration file. Default: false.

a| `backup-dir` [.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*
| Relative or absolute path to a directory in which to store backups of the configuration file. Each new backup will be created inside this directory. Default: A new directory called `dynamic-configuration-backups` is created in the member's startup directory.                            

a| `backup-count` [.enterprise]*{enterprise-product-name}*
| Number of backups of the configuration file to keep. To disable backups, set this option to 0. Default: 5.
