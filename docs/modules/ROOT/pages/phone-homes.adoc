= Phone Homes

Hazelcast uses phone home data to learn about the
usage of Hazelcast.

Hazelcast member instances call our phone
home server initially when they are started and
then every 24 hours. This applies to all the instances
joined to the cluster.

**Disabling Phone Homes**

Set the `hazelcast.phone.home.enabled` system property to
false either in the config
or on the Java command line. See the
xref:system-properties.adoc[System Properties appendix] for information about how to set a property.

You can also disable the phone home using the environment variable `HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED`.

Simply add the following line to your `.bash_profile`:

```
export HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED=false
```
