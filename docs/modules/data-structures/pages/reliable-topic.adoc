= Reliable Topic
[[reliable-topic]]

Reliable Topic provides a simple publish-subscribe (pub/sub) messaging API which can be used as a data sink within a pipeline. 

Reliable Topic is an enhanced version of the regular Topic and uses the same `ITopic` interface. However, Reliable Topic is backed up by the Ringbuffer data structure which offers several advantages:

* Events are not lost since the Ringbuffer is configured with one
synchronous backup by default
* Each Reliable `ITopic` gets its own Ringbuffer; if a topic has a
very fast producer, it will not lead to problems at topics that run at a slower pace
* Since the event system behind a regular `ITopic` is shared with other
data structures, e.g., collection listeners,
  you can run into isolation problems. This does not happen with the Reliable `ITopic`

Use Reliable Topic when you need a robust, durable messaging system that can handle high throughput without losing messages, especially in scenarios where message delivery guarantees are crucial.

For more information about the metrics provided by Reliable Topic, see xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#topic-statistics[Topic Statistics].

Here is an example for a publisher using Reliable Topic:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/dds/reliabletopic/PublisherMember.java[tag=publisher]
----

And the following is an example for the subscriber:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/dds/reliabletopic/SubscribedMember.java[tag=sm]
----

When you create a Reliable Topic, Hazelcast automatically creates a
Ringbuffer for it. You may configure this Ringbuffer by adding a Ringbuffer config
with the same name as the Reliable Topic. For instance, if you have a
Reliable Topic with the name "sometopic", you should add a Ringbuffer config
with the name "sometopic" to configure the backing Ringbuffer. Some of the
things that you may configure are the capacity, the time-to-live for the topic
messages, and you can even add a Ringbuffer store which allows you to have a persistent topic.
By default, a Ringbuffer does not have any TTL (time-to-live) and it has a limited
capacity; you may want to change that configuration. The following is an example
configuration for the "sometopic" given above.

See the <<configuring-reliable-topic, Configuring Reliable Topic section>>
below for the descriptions of all Reliable Topic configuration elements.

By default, the Reliable `ITopic` uses a shared thread pool. If you need a
better isolation, you can configure a custom executor on the
`ReliableTopicConfig`.

Because the reads on a Ringbuffer are not destructive, batching is easy to apply.
`ITopic` uses read batching and reads
ten items at a time (if available) by default. See xref:data-structures:ringbuffer.adoc#reading-batched-items[Reading Batched Items].
for more information.

[[slow-consumers]]
== Slow Consumers

The Reliable `ITopic` provides control and a way to deal with slow consumers.
It is unwise to keep events for a slow consumer in memory
indefinitely since you do not know when the slow consumer is going to catch up.
You can control the size of the Ringbuffer by using its capacity. For the cases
when a Ringbuffer runs out of its capacity, you can specify the following policies
for the `TopicOverloadPolicy` configuration:

* `DISCARD_OLDEST`: Overwrite the oldest item, even if a TTL is set.
In this case the fast producer supersedes a slow consumer.
* `DISCARD_NEWEST`: Discard the newest item.
* `BLOCK`: Wait until the items are expired in the Ringbuffer.
* `ERROR`: Immediately throw `TopicOverloadException` if there is no space in the Ringbuffer.

The following are example Reliable Topic configurations.


**Declarative Configuration:**

XML::

<hazelcast>
    ...
    <reliable-topic name="default">
        <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>

      read-batch-size: 10
      topic-overload-policy: BLOCK

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
ReliableTopicConfig rtConfig = config.getReliableTopicConfig( "default" );
rtConfig.setTopicOverloadPolicy( TopicOverloadPolicy.BLOCK )
    .setReadBatchSize( 10 )
    .setStatisticsEnabled( true );
----

Reliable Topic configuration has the following elements:

* `statistics-enabled`: Specifies whether the statistics gathering is
enabled for your Reliable Topic. If set to `false`, you cannot collect statistics
in your implementation and also
xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:monitor-dds.adoc#monitoring-reliable-topics[Hazelcast Management Center]
will not show them. Its default value is `true`.
* `message-listener`: Message listener class that listens to the
messages when they are added or removed.
* `read-batch-size`: Minimum number of messages that Reliable Topic
tries to read in batches. Its default value is 10.
* `topic-overload-policy`: Policy to handle an overloaded topic.
Available values are `DISCARD_OLDEST`, `DISCARD_NEWEST`, `BLOCK` and `ERROR`.
The default value is `BLOCK`. See <<slow-consumers, Slow Consumers>> for definitions of these policies.
