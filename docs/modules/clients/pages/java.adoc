:description: Hazelcast provides a {java-client} within the standard distribution you can start using right away, and also a lightweight {java-client-new} that is available in Beta.
[[java-client]]

== Overview

This topic is aimed at developers and describes basic usage, configuration, and advanced features.

Hazelcast provides a {java-client} which you can use to connect to a Hazelcast cluster. `hazelcast-<VERSION>.jar` is bundled in the Hazelcast standard package, so you simply add this file to your classpath to begin using the client as if you are using the Hazelcast API.

Alternatively, if you want to use a standalone or lightweight Java client, you can try the {java-client-new}. This client is currently available as Beta functionality but can interact with a Hazelcast cluster without being a full member. Note that the {java-client-new} doesn't have full feature parity with the {java-client} yet and is not recommended for production environments. For more information, see xref:java#java-client-standalone-beta[].

NOTE: Where there are differences between {java-client} and {java-client-new}, this documentation will specify the appropriate client. Otherwise, assume that generic references to client refer to both versions of the Java client.

// check production recommendation

Both clients enable you to use the Hazelcast API — this topic explains any differences or technical details that affect usage. Read this alongside the respective Javadoc-generated API documentation available from within your IDE together with the following:

* https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc[Hazelcast {java-client} API documentation]
* https://docs.hazelcast.org/hazelcast-java-client/{page-latest-supported-java-client-new}/javadoc[Hazelcast {java-client-new} API documentation]

== Get started

* xref:java#get-started-with-java-client-and-embedded-server[]
* xref:java#get-started-with-java-client-standalone-beta[]

=== Get started with {java-client}

To get started using the {java-client}, you need to include the `hazelcast.jar` dependency in your classpath. You can then start using this client as if you are using the Hazelcast API. 

NOTE: If you have a Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} license, you don't need to set the license key in your Hazelcast Java clients to use the xref:getting-started:editions.adoc#features-in-hazelcast-enterprise[{enterprise-product-name} features]. You only have to set it on the member side, and include the `hazelcast-enterprise-<VERSION>.jar` dependency in your classpath.

If you prefer to use Maven, make sure you have added the appropriate `hazelcast` or `hazelcast-enterprise` dependency to your `pom.xml`:

[tabs] 
==== 
{enterprise-product-name}::

You can find {java-client} code samples in the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/clients[Hazelcast Code Samples repository].

TIP: For a tutorial on getting started with Java in an embedded topology, see xref:getting-started:get-started-java.adoc[].

=== Get started with {java-client-new} (BETA)

To get started using the {java-client-new}, you need to add the `hazelcast-java-client` dependency to your pom.xml, as shown below. You can then start using this client as if
you are using the Hazelcast API.
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>{java-client-standalone-version}</version>

----

If you are using `hazelcast-enterprise-java-client`, you need to add the `hazelcast-enterprise-java-client` dependency and private hazelcast repository to your pom.xml file, as shown below:
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>

==== Migrate to {java-client-new} (BETA)
To migrate an application from the {java-client} to the {java-client-new}, you only have to update the dependency as described above.

[java-client-standalone]
==== {java-client-new} (BETA)

The {java-client-new} is only available as a Beta release and does not have full feature parity with the {java-client}. Please note the following differences and restrictions:

// check standalone

* Hazelcast Cloud is not supported
* You cannot use the {java-client} and the {java-client-new} on the same JVM
* Any methods that raise the`UnsupportedOperationException` exception are not available e.g. `addLocalEntryListener(@Nonnull MapListener listener)`
* MultiMap and Set are not supported data structures
* Some client system properties are not supported (see individual notes)

=== Client API
The Client API is your gateway to access your Hazelcast cluster, including distributed objects and data pipelines (jobs).

First, you must configure your client. You can use either xref:configuration:understanding-configuration.adoc[declarative or
programmatic configuration] to do this.

The following examples demonstrate the programmatic approach.

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.setClusterName("dev");
clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().addAddress("10.90.0.1", "10.90.0.2:5702");
----

For further information on client configuration, see <<configure-java-client, Configure the client>>.

After completing the client configuration, you must create an `HazelcastClient` instance that will initialize and connect to the client based on the specified configuration:

```java
HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
```

You can create a distributed map and populate it with some data as follows:

[source,java]
----
IMap<String, Customer> mapCustomers = client.getMap("customers"); //creates the map proxy

mapCustomers.put("1", new Customer("Joe", "Smith"));
mapCustomers.put("2", new Customer("Ali", "Selam"));
mapCustomers.put("3", new Customer("Avi", "Noyan"));
----

For further information about using maps, see xref:data-structures:map.adoc[].

Lastly, after setting up your client, you can shut it down as follows:

```java
client.shutdown();
```

This command releases all used resources and closes all connections to the cluster.

== Distributed data structures

=== Supported data structures

Hazelcast offers distributed implementations of many common data structures, most of which are supported by the {java-client} and {java-client-new}.

When you use clients in other languages, you should review the appropriate client documentation for exceptions and details. As a general rule, you should configure these data structures on the server side and
access them through a proxy on the client side.

=== Use Map

You can use any distributed map object with the client, as follows:

[source,java]
----
Imap<Integer, String> map = client.getMap("myMap");

map.put(1, "John");
String value= map.get(1);
map.remove(1);
----

The `addLocalEntryListener()` and `localKeySet()` methods are not supported because locality is ambiguous for the client. For more information, see xref:data-structures:map.adoc[].

=== Use MultiMap

NOTE: This section is only applicable to the {java-client}.

You can use a distributed multiMap object with the {java-client}, as follows:

[source,java]
----
MultiMap<Integer, String> multiMap = client.getMultiMap("myMultiMap");

multiMap.put(1,"John");
multiMap.put(1,"Mary");

Collection<String> values = multiMap.get(1);
----

The `addLocalEntryListener()`, `localKeySet()` and `getLocalMultiMapStats()` methods are not
supported because locality is ambiguous for the client. For more information, see xref:data-structures:multimap.adoc[].

=== Use Queue

You can use a distributed Queue object with the client, as follows: 

[source,java]
----
IQueue<String> myQueue = client.getQueue("theQueue");
myQueue.offer("John")
----

The `getLocalQueueStats()` method is not supported because locality is ambiguous for the client.
For more information, see xref:data-structures:queue.adoc[]. 

=== Use Topic

The `getLocalTopicStats()` method is not supported because locality is ambiguous for the client.

=== Other supported distributed structures

The distributed data structures listed below are also supported.
The logic is the same for both member and client side, so see the specific sections for more information on usage.

* xref:data-structures:replicated-map.adoc[Replicated Map]
* xref:data-structures:list.adoc[List]
* xref:data-structures:set.adoc[Set] (not supported by {java-client-new})

== Configure the client
=== Client cluster routing modes
The cluster routing mode specifies how the client connects to the cluster. It can currently be used only with Java and .NET clients.

NOTE: In previous releases, this functionality was known as the client operation mode and could be configured as smart or unisocket. 
If the cluster routing mode is not configured in your client, the configured client operation mode is used.

The mode that you use depends on your network requirements due to the distributed nature of the data and cluster.

In all modes, the following information is provided to the client on initial connection:

* Cluster version
* Member details, including instance name, IP or UUID, partition group information, CP membership status, and type ({enterprise-product-name} only)
* Partition group information ({enterprise-product-name} only)
* CP group leader information ({enterprise-product-name} with `Advanced CP` enabled only) 

The client is updated whenever the cluster version, cluster topology, partition groups, or CP group leader changes.

From {enterprise-product-name} 5.5, you can use any of the following cluster routing modes:

* **ALL_MEMBERS** 
+
The default mode, and is the equivalent of the legacy **Smart** client operation mode. 
+
In `ALL_MEMBERS` cluster routing mode, clients connect to each cluster member. 
+
Since clients are aware of xref:overview:data-partitioning.adoc[data partitions], they are able to send an operation directly
to the cluster member that owns the partition holding their data, which increases the overall throughput and efficiency.
+
If <<configure-direct-to-leader-routing, CP direct-to-leader routing>> is enabled on your clients, and the `ADVANCED_CP`
license is present on your Enterprise cluster, then clients in this routing mode can use this to send CP operations
directly to group leaders wherever possible, even after leadership changes.

* **SINGLE_MEMBER** 
+
In `SINGLE_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, clients only connect to one of the configured addresses. This is the equivalent of the legacy **Unisocket** client operation mode.
+
In some environments, clients must connect to only a single member instead of to each member in the cluster; 
for example, this can be enforced due to firewalls, security, or a custom network consideration.
In these environments, `SINGLE_MEMBER` mode allows to you connect to a single member, while retaining the ability to work with other members in the cluster.
+
The single connected member behaves as a gateway to the other members of the cluster.
When the client makes a request, the connected member redirects the request to the relevant member and
returns the response from that member to the client.

* **MULTI_MEMBER** 
+
This mode provides most of the functionality of `ALL_MEMBERS` routing over a single partition group, falling back to the more
restricted behavior of `SINGLE_MEMBER` mode for members outside that partition group as follows:
+
** The client can connect to all members in the defined partition group
** Outside the visible partition group, a member in the defined partition group acts as a gateway to the other members in the cluster

+
--
In `MULTI_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, the client connection flow is as follows:

. Connect to the first member 
The client then has visibility of the partition group associated with the first member. 

. Read the partition group information
. Connect to a limited subset of the cluster as defined by the partition grouping
The client does not have a connection to any cluster members outside this partition group, but it will have knowledge of all cluster members
--

The following diagram shows how each mode connects to members in a cluster:

image:ROOT:client-routing.png[Hazelcast Cluster Routing diagram]

For information on configuring the cluster routing mode, see <<configure-cluster-routing-mode,Configure Cluster Routing Mode>>.

If already using the legacy **Smart** and **Unisocket** client operation modes, these remain supported. However, we recommend that you update your configuration to use the appropriate cluster routing mode as these options will be removed in a future major version. For information on these modes and their configuration, select **5.4** from the version picker at the top of the navigation pane. Ensure that the cluster routing mode is not configured at the same time as the legacy client operation mode, only one should be defined.

=== Handling failures
// quick edit; move to Failures section?
The main areas are around client connections and retry-able operations. Some approaches to avoiding such failures are provided below.

==== Client connection failure

While the client initially tries to connect to one of the members in the `ClientNetworkConfig.addressList`, it's possible that not all members are available.
Instead of giving up, throwing an exception and stopping, the client continues to attempt to connect as configured.
For information on the available configuration, see <<configure-client-connection-retry, Configure client connection retry>>.

The client executes each operation through the already established connection to the cluster.
If this connection disconnects or drops, the client tries to reconnect as configured.

If using the `MULTI_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, and the cluster has multiple partition groups defined 
and the client connection to a partition group fails, connectivity is maintained by failing over to an alternative partition group.
If the connection is lost, which occurs only if all members of the partition group become unavailable, there is no attempt to retry the connection before failing over to another partition group.
For more information on client cluster routing modes, see <<client-cluster-routing-modes,Client cluster routing modes>>.

==== Retry-able operations failure

While sending the requests to related members, operations can fail due to various reasons.
Read-only operations are retried by default. If you want to enable retry for the other operations,
you can set the `redoOperation` to `true`. For more info, see <<enable-redo-operation, Enable redo operation>>.

You can set a timeout for retrying the operations sent to a member.
This can be provided by using the `hazelcast.client.invocation.timeout.seconds` property in `ClientProperties`.
The client retries an operation within this given period, if it is a read-only operation, or if
you enabled the `redoOperation` as described above.
This timeout value is important when there is a failure caused by any of the following:

* Member throws an exception
* Connection between the client and member is closed
* Client's heartbeat requests time out

See <<client-system-properties, Client system roperties>> for a description of the `hazelcast.client.invocation.timeout.seconds` property.

When any failure happens between a client and member (such as an exception on the member side or connection issues), an operation is retried if:

* it is certain that it has not run on the member yet
* it is idempotent such as a read-only operation, i.e. retrying does not have a side effect.

If it is not certain whether the operation has run on the member, then the non-idempotent operations are not retried.
However, as explained earlier, you can force all client operations to be retried (`redoOperation`) when there is a failure between the client and member.
But in this case, some operations may run multiple times and therefore cause conflicts.
For example, assume that your client sent a `queue.offer` operation to the member and then the connection is lost. Because there is no respond for this operation, you won't know whether it has run on the member or not. If you enabled `redoOperation`, that specific `queue.offer` operation may rerun and this will cause the same objects to be offered twice in the member's queue.

=== Configure client listeners

You can configure global event listeners using `ListenerConfig` as the following examples show:

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
ListenerConfig listenerConfig = new ListenerConfig(LifecycleListenerImpl);
clientConfig.addListenerConfig(listenerConfig);
----

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
ListenerConfig listenerConfig = new ListenerConfig("com.hazelcast.example.MembershipListenerImpl");
clientConfig.addListenerConfig(listenerConfig);
----

You can add the following types of event listeners:

* `LifecycleListener``
* `MembershipListener``
* `DistributedObjectListener``

=== Configure client near cache

To increase the performance of local read operations, the distributed map supports a local near cache for remotely stored entries. Because the client always requests data from
the cluster members, it can be helpful in some use cases to configure a near cache on the client side. For a detailed explanation of this feature and its configuration, see xref:performance:near-cache.adoc[Near cache].

=== Configure client cluster name

Clients should provide a cluster name in order to connect to the cluster.
You can configure it using `ClientConfig`, as the following example shows:

```
clientConfig.setClusterName("dev");
```

[[client-security-configuration]]
=== Configure client security
[blue]*Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}* 

You can define control mechanisms for clients to control authentication and authorisation. For more information, see xref:security:client-authorization.adoc[].

You can provide the Java client with an identity for cluster authentication. The identity of the connecting client is defined on the client side.
Usually, there are no security realms on the clients; only the identity defined in the security configuration.

On the clients, you can use the same identity types as in the security realms:

* `username-password`
* `token`
* `kerberos` (may require an additional security realm definition)
* `credentials-factory`

==== Security realms on the client side

Hazelcast offers limited support for security realms in the Java client.
You can configure the client to use JAAS login modules that can be referenced from
the Kerberos identity configuration.

[[classloader]]
=== Configure ClassLoader

You can configure a custom `classLoader` for your client.
It is used by the serialization service and loads any class specified in the configuration, including event listeners or ProxyFactories.

[[configuring-direct-to-leader-routing]]
=== Configure CP direct-to-leader operation routing for clients

When operating a Hazelcast Enterprise cluster with the `ADVANCED_CP` license it is possible to configure clients to
leverage direct-to-leader routing for xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP Subsystem] operations. When enabled,
this functionality enables clients to receive a mapping of CP group leadership from the cluster and use it to send
CP data structure operations directly to the relevant group leader. This leadership mapping is also updated whenever
leadership changes occur.

CP data structure reads and writes must be actioned by the CP leader responsible for the group involved. By leveraging
direct-to-leader routing for CP operations, clients are able to send all operations directly to their group leaders,
cutting out the need for intermediate hops through other cluster members. This allows clients to achieve lower latency and
higher throughput for their CP operations, while also reducing the pressure on the internal cluster network, resulting in
greater cluster stability.

This functionality is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled. This is done because you should consider your
specific use-case for CP operation sending and assess the impact of direct to leader routing on your topology. In scenarios
where clients have increased latency to CP group leaders, it may be detrimental to route all operations directly to them
instead of using a faster internal cluster link and routing through another member. You should also consider that
direct-to-leader routing can put uneven pressure on the cluster if CP group leaders receive a substantially greater load than
other members of the cluster, which is particularly problematic when only one CP group leader is present.

NOTE: If a client does not have an active connection to a known CP group leader then the client will be unable to leverage
direct-to-leader CP operations and will fall back to default round-robin behaviour, sending the request to any available
cluster member instead. This feature provides no benefit when `SINGLE_MEMBER` routing is used as the client only has 1
available connection to use for all operation sending.

You can enable CP direct-to-leader routing with a single configuration option, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.setCPDirectToLeaderRoutingEnabled(true);
----

The following code shows the equivalent declarative configuration:

[tabs]

----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  ...
  cp-direct-to-leader-routing: true
  ...
----
====

=== Java client connection strategy

You can configure the client's starting mode as async or sync using
the configuration element `async-start`. When it is set to `true` (async),
Hazelcast creates the client without waiting for a connection to the cluster.
In this case, the client instance throws an exception until it connects to the cluster.
If it is `false`, the client is not created until the cluster is ready to use clients and
a connection with the cluster is established. The default value is `false` (sync)

You can also configure how the client reconnects to the cluster after a disconnection.
This is configured using the configuration element `reconnect-mode`, which has three options:

* `OFF`: disables the reconnection
* `ON`: enables reconnection in a blocking manner, where all waiting invocations are blocked until
a cluster connection is established or fails
* `ASYNC`: enables reconnection in a non-blocking manner, where all waiting invocations receive a `HazelcastClientOfflineException`.

The default value for `reconnect-mode` is `ON`.

NOTE: When you have `ASYNC` as the `reconnect-mode` and have defined a near cache for your client, the client functions [[non-stop-client]]without interruptions/downtime by communicating the data from its near cache,
provided that there is non-expired data in it. To learn how to add a near cache to your client, see <<configure-client-near-cache, Configure client near cache>>.

The following declarative and programmatic configuration examples show how to configure
a Java client's starting and reconnecting modes:

clientConfig.getConnectionStrategyConfig()
            .setAsyncStart(true)
            .setReconnectMode(ClientConnectionStrategyConfig.ReconnectMode.ASYNC);
----

=== Configure with CNAME

Using CNAME, you can change the hostname resolutions and use them dynamically.

As an example, assume that you have two clusters, Cluster A and Cluster B, and two Java clients.

First, configure the Cluster A members as shown below:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <join>
            <tcp-ip enabled="true">
                <member>clusterA.member1</member>
                <member>clusterA.member2</member>
            </tcp-ip>
        </join>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    join:
      tcp-ip:
        enabled: true
        members: clusterA.member1,clusterA.member2
----
====

Next, configure the Cluster B members as shown below:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <join>
            <tcp-ip enabled="true">
                <member>clusterB.member1</member>
                <member>clusterB.member2</member>
            </tcp-ip>
        </join>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    join:
      tcp-ip:
        enabled: true
        members: clusterB.member1,clusterB.member2
----
====

Now, configure the two clients as shown below:

[tabs] 
==== 
Client 1 XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    ...

Assuming that the client configuration filenames for the above example clients are
`hazelcast-client-c1.xml/yaml` and `hazelcast-client-c2.xml/yaml`, you should configure the
client failover for a blue-green deployment scenario as follows:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client-failover>
    <try-count>4</try-count>
    <clients>
        <client>hazelcast-client-c1.xml</client>
        <client>hazelcast-client-c2.xml</client>
    </clients>
</hazelcast-client-failover>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client-failover:
  try-count: 4
  clients:
    - hazelcast-client-c1.yaml
    - hazelcast-client-c2.yaml
----
====

NOTE: You can find the complete Hazelcast client failover
example configuration file (`hazelcast-client-failover-full-example`)
both in XML and YAML formats including the descriptions of elements and attributes,
in the `/bin` directory of your Hazelcast download directory.

You should also configure your clients to forget DNS lookups using the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html[networkaddress.cache.ttl JVM parameter].

You should also configure the addresses in your clients' configuration to resolve to the hostnames of
Cluster A via CNAME so that the clients will connect to Cluster A when it starts:

`production1.myproject` → `clusterA.member1`

`production2.myproject` → `clusterA.member2`

When you want the clients to switch to the other cluster, change the mapping as follows:
 
`production1.myproject` → `clusterB.member1`

`production2.myproject` → `clusterB.member2`

Wait for the time you configured using the `networkaddress.cache.ttl` JVM parameter for
the client JVM to forget the old mapping.

Finally, blocklist the clients in Cluster A using Hazelcast Management Center.

=== Configure without CNAME

Review these example configurations and the descriptions that follow:

ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.setClusterName("cluster-a");
ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig();
networkConfig.addAddress("10.216.1.18", "10.216.1.19");

ClientConfig clientConfig2 = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig2.setClusterName("cluster-b");

clientFailoverConfig.addClientConfig(clientConfig).addClientConfig(clientConfig2).setTryCount(10)
HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastFailoverClient(clientFailoverConfig);
----

For more information on the configuration elements, see the following descriptions:

* `try-count`: count of connection retries by the client to the alternative clusters. 

When this value is reached, the client shuts down if it can't connect to a cluster. This value also applies to alternative clusters configured by the `client` element. For the above example, two alternative clusters are given
with the `try-count` set as `4`. This means the number of connection attempts is 4 x 2 = 8.

* `client`: path to the client configuration that corresponds to an alternative cluster that the client will try to connect to.

The client configurations must be exactly the same **except** for the following configuration options:

* `SecurityConfig`
* `NetworkConfig.Addresses`
* `NetworkConfig.SocketInterceptorConfig`
* `NetworkConfig.SSLConfig`
* `NetworkConfig.AwsConfig`
* `NetworkConfig.GcpConfig`
* `NetworkConfig.AzureConfig`
* `NetworkConfig.KubernetesConfig`
* `NetworkConfig.EurekaConfig`
* `NetworkConfig.CloudConfig`
* `NetworkConfig.DiscoveryConfig`

You can also configure it within the Spring context, as shown below:

== Configure client network
=== Configuration options

You can manage all network-related configuration setting using either the `network` element (declarative) or the `ClientNetworkConfig` class (programmatic). 

This section provides full examples for these two approaches, and then looks at the sub-elements and attributes in detail.

==== Declarative configuration

The following declarative `network` configuration examples include all the public configuration APIs/methods:

==== Programmatic configuration

The following example programmatic `network` configuration includes all the parent configuration attributes:
// is attributes the right term here?

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/clients/ExampleClientConfiguration.java[tag=scc]
----

The following sections include details and usage examples for sub-elements and attributes.

=== Configure backup acknowledgment

// check standalone

When an operation with sync backup is sent by a client to the Hazelcast member(s),
the acknowledgment of the operation's backup is sent to the client by the backup
replica member(s). This improves the performance of the client operations.

NOTE: Backup acknowledgement is sometimes referred to as _boomerang backups_.

If using the `ALL_MEMBERS` cluster routing mode, backup acknowledgement to the client is enabled by default.
However, neither the `MULTI_MEMBER` nor the `SINGLE_MEMBER` cluster routing modes support backup acknowledgement to the client.

The following declarative example shows how to configure backup acknowledgement:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client ... >
       <backup-ack-to-client-enabled>false</backup-ack-to-client-enabled>
</hazelcast-client>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  backup-ack-to-client: false
----
====

The following programmatic example shows how to configure backup acknowledgement:

[source,java]
----
clientConfig.setBackupAckToClientEnabled(boolean enabled)
----

You can also fine tune this feature using the following system properties:

* `hazelcast.client.operation.backup.timeout.millis`: if an operation has sync
backups, this property specifies how long (in milliseconds) the invocation waits
for acks from the backup replicas. If acks are not received from some
of the backups, there will not be any rollback on the other successful replicas.
The default value is `5000` milliseconds.
* `hazelcast.client.operation.fail.on.indeterminate.state`: when `true`,
if an operation has sync backups and acks are not received from backup replicas
in time, or the member which owns the primary replica of the target partition leaves
the cluster, then the invocation fails. However, even if the invocation fails,
there will not be any rollback on other successful replicas. The default value is `false`.

=== Configure address list

The address List is the initial list of cluster addresses to which the client will connect.
The client uses this list to find an alive member. Although it may be enough to give
only one address of a member in the cluster (since all members communicate with each other),
we recommended that you add the addresses for all the members.

==== Declarative configuration

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <network>
        <cluster-members>
            <address>10.1.1.21</address>
            <address>10.1.1.22:5703</address>
        </cluster-members>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast-client>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  network:
    cluster-members:
      - 10.1.1.21
      - 10.1.1.22:5703
----
====

==== Programmatic configuration

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig();
networkConfig.addAddress("10.1.1.21", "10.1.1.22:5703");
----

You can add addresses with or without the port number. If the port is omitted, then the default ports (5701, 5702, 5703) are tried in random order.

The address list is tried in random order. The default value is `localhost`.

IMPORTANT:  If you have multiple members on a single machine and you are using the
<<client-cluster-routing-modes, `SINGLE_MEMBER` cluster routing mode>>, we recommend that you set explicit
xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#port[ports] for each member. Then you should provide those ports in your client configuration
when you give the member addresses (using the `address` configuration element or
`addAddress` method as exemplified above). This provides faster connections between clients and members. Otherwise,
all the load coming from your clients may go through a single member.

=== Set outbound ports

You may want to restrict outbound ports to be used by Hazelcast-enabled applications.
To fulfill this requirement, you can configure Hazelcast Java client to use only defined outbound ports.
The following are example configurations.

Declarative configuration:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <network>
        <outbound-ports>
            <!-- ports between 34700 and 34710 -->
            <ports>34700-34710</ports>
            <!-- comma separated ports -->
            <ports>34700,34701,34702,34703</ports>
            <ports>34700,34705-34710</ports>
        </outbound-ports>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast-client>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  network:
    outbound-ports:
      - 34700-34710
      - 34700,34701,34702,34703
      - 34700,34705-34710
----
====

Programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
...
NetworkConfig networkConfig = config.getNetworkConfig();
// ports between 34700 and 34710
networkConfig.addOutboundPortDefinition("34700-34710");
// comma separated ports
networkConfig.addOutboundPortDefinition("34700,34701,34702,34703");
networkConfig.addOutboundPort(34705);
...
----

NOTE: You can use port ranges and/or comma separated ports.

As shown in the programmatic configuration, you use the method `addOutboundPort` to
add only one port. If you need to add a group of ports, then use the method `addOutboundPortDefinition`.

In the declarative configuration, the element `ports` can be used for
both single and multiple port definitions.

=== Configure cluster routing mode

You can configure the cluster routing mode to suit your requirements, as described in <<client-cluster-routing-modes,Client Cluster Routing Modes>>.

The following examples show the configuration for each cluster routing mode. 

NOTE: If your clients want to use temporary permissions defined in a member, see 
xref:security:client-authorization.adoc#handling-permissions-when-a-new-member-joins[Handling Permissions].

**Client ALL_MEMBERS routing**

To connect to all members, use the `ALL_MEMBERS` cluster routing mode, which can be defined as follows.

----
--
====

**Client SINGLE_MEMBER routing**

To connect to a single member, which can be used as a gateway to the other members, use the `SINGLE_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, which can be defined as described below.

When using the `SINGLE_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, consider the following:

* The absence of <<configure-backup-acknowledgement, backup acknowledgements>>, as the client does not have a view of the entire cluster
* If you have multiple members on a single machine, we advise that <<configure-address-list,explicit ports are set for each member>>
* If CP group leader priority is assigned appropriately, and the client is explicitly set to connect to a CP group leader,
connections to the xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP Subsystem] are direct-to-leader, which can result in improved performance.
If leadership is reassigned while using `SINGLE_MEMBER` cluster routing, then this benefit may be lost.
* <<configure-load-balancer,`LoadBalancer`>> configuration is ignored
* xref:cluster-performance:thread-per-core-tpc.adoc[Thread-Per-Core] is not supported for `SINGLE_MEMBER` cluster routing and no benefit will be gained by enabling it with this routing mode.

**Client MULTI_MEMBER routing**

To connect to a subset partition grouping of members, which allows direct connection to the specified group and gateway connections to other members, use the `MULTI_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, which can be defined as follows.

To use the `MULTI_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, you must also define the grouping strategy to apply. For further information on configuring partition groups, see xref:clusters:partition-group-configuration.adoc[]. 

When using the `MULTI_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, consider the following:

* The <<handling-client-configuration-failure,handling of connection failures>>, which failover to another partition group where one is available. 
No retry attempt is made to connect to the lost member(s) 
+
In a split and heal scenario, where the client has no access to other group members, the client is re-assigned to the initial group. 
+
In a scenario where all group members are killed almost simultaneously, the client loses connection but reconnects when a member starts again.

* The absence of <<configure-backup-acknowledgement, backup acknowledgements>>, as the client does not have a view of the entire cluster
If <<configure-direct-to-leader-routing, CP direct-to-leader routing>> is enabled on your clients, and the `ADVANCED_CP` license
is present on your Enterprise cluster, then clients in this routing mode can use this to send CP operations directly
to group leaders wherever possible, even after leadership changes.
* Best efforts are made to route operations to the required member, but if this cannot be done operations are routed as defined in the <<configure-load-balancer,`LoadBalancer`>>

* xref:cluster-performance:thread-per-core-tpc.adoc[Thread-Per-Core] is not supported for `MULTI_MEMBER` cluster routing and may lead to event inconsistency if used.

TIP: If you are using the `smart` or `unisocket` client operation modes, select **5.4** from the version picker above the navigation pane to see the configuration information. The cluster routing mode described above must not be present in your configuration.

=== Enable redo operations

It enables/disables redo-able operations as described in
<<handling-failures, Handling Retry-able Operation Failure>>.
The following are the example configurations.

Declarative Configuration:

Programmatic Configuration:

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig();
networkConfig().setRedoOperation(true);
----

Its default value is `false` (disabled).

=== Set connection timeout

Connection timeout is the timeout value in milliseconds for members to
accept client connection requests. 

The following code shows a declarative example configuration:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>

The following code shows a programmatic example configuration:

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().setConnectionTimeout(5000);
----

The default value is *5000* milliseconds.

=== Set a socket interceptor

[blue]*Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}*

Any class implementing `com.hazelcast.nio.SocketInterceptor` is a socket interceptor.
The following code sample shows an example of how to set a socket interceptor:

[source,java]
----
public interface SocketInterceptor {
    void init(Properties properties);
    void onConnect(Socket connectedSocket) throws IOException;
}
----

The first method initializes the `SocketInterceptor` using the defined properties.
The second method informs when the socket is connected using the `onConnect` method.

The following example shows how to create a SocketInterceptor and add it to the client configuration:

[source,java]
----
SocketInterceptorConfig socketInterceptorConfig = clientConfig
               .getNetworkConfig().getSocketInterceptorConfig();

MyClientSocketInterceptor myClientSocketInterceptor = new MyClientSocketInterceptor();

socketInterceptorConfig.setEnabled(true);
socketInterceptorConfig.setImplementation(myClientSocketInterceptor);
----

// need comment for above?

If you want to configure the socket interceptor with a class name instead of an instance,
see the example below:

[source,java]
----
SocketInterceptorConfig socketInterceptorConfig = clientConfig
            .getNetworkConfig().getSocketInterceptorConfig();

socketInterceptorConfig.setEnabled(true);

//These properties are provided to the interceptor during init
socketInterceptorConfig.setProperty("kerberos-host","kerb-host-name");
socketInterceptorConfig.setProperty("kerberos-config-file","kerb.conf");

socketInterceptorConfig.setClassName(MyClientSocketInterceptor.class.getName());
----

NOTE: For more information, see xref:security:socket-interceptor.adoc[Socket interceptor].

=== Configure network socket options

You can configure the network socket options using `SocketOptions`. It has the following methods:

* `socketOptions.setKeepAlive(x)`: Enables/disables the *SO_KEEPALIVE* socket option.
The default value is `true`.
* `socketOptions.setTcpNoDelay(x)`: Enables/disables the *TCP_NODELAY* socket option.
The default value is `true`.
* `socketOptions.setReuseAddress(x)`: Enables/disables the *SO_REUSEADDR* socket option.
The default value is `true`.
* `socketOptions.setLingerSeconds(x)`: Enables/disables *SO_LINGER* with the specified linger time in seconds.
The default value is `3`.
* `socketOptions.setBufferSize(x)`: Sets the *SO_SNDBUF* and *SO_RCVBUF* options to the specified value in KB for this Socket.
The default value is `32`.


[source,java]
----
SocketOptions socketOptions = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().getSocketOptions();
socketOptions.setBufferSize(32)
             .setKeepAlive(true)
             .setTcpNoDelay(true)
             .setReuseAddress(true)
             .setLingerSeconds(3);
----

=== Enable client TLS
[blue]*Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}*

You can use TLS to secure the connection between the client and the members.
If you want TLS enabled for the client-cluster connection, you should set `SSLConfig`.
For more information, see xref:security:tls-ssl.adoc[TLS].

NOTE: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the predecessor protocol to TLS (Transport Layer Security).
Both protocols encrypt and secure data transmitted over networks but SSL is now considered outdated and has been replaced by TLS for improved security.
Hazelcast code still refers to `ssl` in places for backward compatibility but consider these references to also include TLS.

Keys and certificates in `keyStores` are used to prove identity to the other side of the connection, and `trustStores` are used to
specify trusted parties (from which the connection should be accepted).
Clients only need to have their `keyStores` specified when xref:security:tls-ssl.adoc#mutual-authentication[TLS Mutual Authentication] is
required by members.

For a programmatic example, see this xref:java#programmatic-configuration-5[code example].

=== Configure Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud}

NOTE: This section is only applicable to the {java-client}.

You can connect the {java-client} to a {hazelcast-cloud} Standard cluster which is hosted on link:{url-cloud-signup}[{hazelcast-cloud}].
For this, you need to enable {hazelcast-cloud} and specify the cluster's discovery token provided while creating the cluster; this allows the cluster to discover your clients.
See the following example configurations:

==== Declarative configuration

networkConfig.getCloudConfig().setDiscoveryToken("TOKEN").setEnabled(true);
networkConfig.setSSLConfig(new SSLConfig().setEnabled(true));
HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(config);
----

{hazelcast-cloud} is disabled for the Java client, by default (`enabled` attribute is `false`).

See xref:cloud:ROOT:overview.adoc[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud}] for more information about {hazelcast-cloud}.

NOTE: Because this is a REST based discovery, you need to enable the REST listener service.
See the xref:clients:rest.adoc#using-the-rest-endpoint-groups[REST Endpoint Groups section] on how to enable REST endpoints.

include::partial$rest-deprecation.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
For security reasons, we recommend you enable certificate revocation status JRE-wide.
You need to set the following Java system properties to `true`:

* `com.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation`
* `com.sun.security.enableCRLDP`

And you need to set the Java security property as follows:

`Security.setProperty("ocsp.enable", "true")`

You can find more details on the related security topics from the Oracle Docs on
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#CERTPATH[JSSE Ref Guide] and

=== Configure client for AWS

The example declarative and programmatic configurations below show
how to configure a Java client for connecting to a Hazelcast cluster in AWS (Amazon Web Services).

==== Declarative Configuration

      tag-value: hz-members
----
====

==== Programmatic Configuration

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/clients/ExampleClientAwsConfig.java[tag=clientaws]
----

For more information on AWS configuration elements (except `use-public-ip`), see xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#aws-element[AWS Element section on network configuration].

If the `use-public-ip` element is set to `true`, the private addresses of cluster members
are always converted to public addresses. Also, the client uses public addresses to
connect to the members. In order to use private addresses, set the `use-public-ip` parameter to `false`.

NOTE: When connecting outside from AWS, if you set the `use-public-ip` parameter to `false` then
the client will not be able to reach the members.

== Use client services

Hazelcast provides the following client services.

=== Use distributed executor service

The distributed executor service is for distributed computing.
It can be used to execute tasks on the cluster on a designated partition or on all the partitions.
It can also be used to process entries. For more information, see xref:computing:executor-service.adoc[].

```
IExecutorService executorService = client.getExecutorService("default");
```

After getting an instance of `IExecutorService`, you can use the instance as
the interface with the one provided on the server side. See
xref:computing:distributed-computing.adoc[] for detailed usage.

=== Listen to client connections

If you need to track clients and want to listen to their connection events,
you can use the `clientConnected()` and `clientDisconnected()` methods of the `ClientService` class.
This class must be run on the **member** side. The following code shows an example of how to do this:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/clients/ListeningClients.java[tag=lc]
----

=== Find the partition of a key

You use the partition service to find the partition of a key.
It returns all partitions. See the example code below:

[source,java]
----
PartitionService partitionService = client.getPartitionService();

//partition of a key
Partition partition = partitionService.getPartition(key);

//all partitions
Set<Partition> partitions = partitionService.getPartitions();
----

=== Handling Lifecycle

Lifecycle handling performs:

* checking if the client is running
* shutting down the client gracefully
* terminating the client ungracefully (forced shutdown)
* adding/removing lifecycle listeners.

[source,java]
----
LifecycleService lifecycleService = client.getLifecycleService();

if(lifecycleService.isRunning()){
    //it is running
}

//shutdown client gracefully
lifecycleService.shutdown();
----

// == Client messaging
== Build data pipeline

To build a data pipeline:

[source,java]
----
Pipeline EvenNumberStream = Pipeline.create(); 
EvenNumberStream.readFrom(TestSources.itemStream(10)) 
  .withoutTimestamps() 
  .filter(event -> event.sequence() % 2 == 0) 
  .setName("filter out odd numbers") 
  .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
client.getJet().newJob(EvenNumberStream);
----

For details about data pipelines, see xref:pipelines:overview.adoc[].

=== Define client labels
// decide placement

You can define labels in your Java client, similar to the way labels are used for members. 
With client labels you can assign special roles for your clients and
use these roles to perform actions specific to those client connections. For more information on labels, see xref:management:cluster-utilities.adoc[Cluster Utilities].

You can also group your clients using labels. You can use Hazelcast Management Center to blocklist these client groups to prevent them connecting to a cluster. For more information, see xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:clusters:client-filtering.adoc[].

The following declarative example shows how to define client using the `client-labels`
configuration element:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <instance-name>barClient</instance-name>
    <client-labels>
        <label>user</label>
        <label>bar</label>
    </client-labels>
    ....
</hazelcast-client>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  instance-name: barClient
  client-labels:
    - user
    - bar
----
====

The following programmatic example shows how to define client using the `client-labels`
configuration element:

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.setInstanceName("ExampleClientName");
clientConfig.addLabel("user");
clientConfig.addLabel("bar");

HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
----

For an working code sample using client labels, see the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/clients/client-labels[Client labels code sample].

== Query with SQL
To query a map using SQL:

[source,java]
----
String query =
        "SELECT * FROM customers csv_likes";
try (SqlResult result = client.getSql().execute(query)) {
    for (SqlRow row : result) {
        System.out.println("" + row.getObject(0));
    }
}
----

For details about querying with SQL, see xref:query:sql-overview.adoc[].

// == Advanced configuration
// change level

== Client system properties

There are some advanced client configuration properties that help you tune the {java-client}. 
You can set them as property name and value pairs through either declarative or programmatic configuration, or with a JVM system property. For more information on system properties in general, including how to set them, see xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc[System Properties].

// big overlap with System properties, section needs review and edit

NOTE: You need to restart clients after modifying system properties.

[cols="4a,1,1,4a"]
.Client System Properties
|===
|Property Name | Default Value | Type | Description

|`hazelcast.client.cloud.discovery.token`
|
|long
|Token to use when discovering the cluster via {hazelcast-cloud}. 

NOTE: Not supported by {java-client-new}.

|`hazelcast.client.concurrent.window.ms`
|100
|int
|Property needed for concurrency detection so that write through and dynamic response handling
can be done correctly. This property sets the window for a concurrency detection (duration when it signals
that a concurrency has been detected), even if there are no further updates in that window.
Normally in a concurrent system the windows keeps sliding forward so it always remains concurrent.
Setting it too high effectively disables the optimization because once concurrency has been detected
it will keep that way. Setting it too low could lead to suboptimal performance because the system
will try to use write-through and other optimizations even though the system is concurrent.

NOTE: Not supported by {java-client-new}.

|`hazelcast.discovery.enabled`
|false
|bool
|Enables/disables the Discovery SPI lookup over the old native implementations.
See xref:extending-hazelcast:discovery-spi.adoc[Discovery SPI] for more information.

|`hazelcast.discovery.public.ip.enabled`
|false
|bool
|Enables the discovery joiner to use public IPs from `DiscoveredNode`.
See xref:extending-hazelcast:discovery-spi.adoc[Discovery SPI] for more information.
When set to `true`, the client assumes that it needs to use public IP addresses reported by the members.
When set to `false`, the client always uses private addresses reported by the members. If it is `null`,
the client will try to infer how the discovery mechanism should be based on the reachability of the members.
This inference is not 100% reliable and may result in false-negatives.

|`hazelcast.client.event.queue.capacity`
|1000000
|int
|Default value of the capacity of executor that handles the incoming event packets.

|`hazelcast.client.event.thread.count`
|5
|int
|Thread count for handling the incoming event packets.

|`hazelcast.client.heartbeat.interval`
|5000
|int
|Frequency of the heartbeat messages sent by the clients to members.

|`hazelcast.client.heartbeat.timeout`
|60000
|int
|Timeout for the heartbeat messages sent by the client to members.
If no messages pass between the client and member within the given time via
this property in milliseconds, the connection will be closed.

|`hazelcast.client.invocation.backoff.timeout.millis`
|-1
|int
|Controls the maximum timeout, in milliseconds, to wait for an invocation space to be available.
If an invocation cannot be made because there are too many pending invocations,
then an exponential backoff is done to give the system time to deal with
the backlog of invocations. This property controls how long an invocation is
allowed to wait before getting a `HazelcastOverloadException`.
When set to -1 then `HazelcastOverloadException` is thrown immediately without any waiting.

|`hazelcast.client.invocation.retry.pause.millis`
|1000
|int
|Pause time between each retry cycle of an invocation in milliseconds.

|`hazelcast.client.invocation.timeout.seconds`
|120
|int
|Period, in seconds, to give up the invocation when a member in the member list is not reachable,
or the member fails with an exception, or the client's heartbeat requests are timed out.

|`hazelcast.client.io.balancer.interval.seconds`
|20
|int
|Interval in seconds between each `IOBalancer`
execution. By default Hazelcast uses 3 threads to read
data from TCP connections and 3 threads to write data to connections.
`IOBalancer` detects and fixes the fluctuations when these threads are not
utilized equally. The shorter intervals catch I/O imbalances faster, but they cause higher overhead.
A value smaller than 1 disables the balancer.

|`hazelcast.client.io.input.thread.count`
|-1
|int
|Controls the number of I/O input threads. Defaults to -1, i.e., the system decides.
If the client is using either the `ALL_MEMBERS` or the `MULTI_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, it defaults to 3, otherwise it defaults to 1.

|`hazelcast.client.io.output.thread.count`
|-1
|int
|Controls the number of I/O output threads. Defaults to -1, i.e., the system decides.
If the client is using either the `ALL_MEMBERS` or the `MULTI_MEMBER` cluster routing mode, it defaults to 3, otherwise it defaults to 1.

|`hazelcast.client.io.write.through`
|true
|bool
|Optimization that allows sending of packets over the network to be done on the calling thread if the
conditions are right. This can reduce the latency and increase the performance for low threaded environments.

|`hazelcast.client.max.concurrent.invocations`
|Integer.MAX_VALUE
|int
|Maximum allowed number of concurrent invocations. You can apply a constraint on
the number of concurrent invocations in order to prevent the system from overloading.
If the maximum number of concurrent invocations is exceeded and a new invocation comes in,
Hazelcast throws `HazelcastOverloadException`.

|`hazelcast.client.metrics.collection.frequency`
| 5
| int
| Frequency, in seconds, of the xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#metrics[metrics] collection cycle. Note that
the preferred way for controlling this setting is xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#metrics#metrics-configuration[Metrics Configuration].

|`hazelcast.client.metrics.debug.enabled`
| false
| bool
| Enables collecting debug metrics if set to `true`, disables it otherwise.
Note that this is meant to be enabled only if diagnostics is enabled, since currently only diagnostics consumes the debug metrics.

|`hazelcast.client.metrics.enabled`
| true
| bool
| Enables the xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#metrics[metrics collection] if set to `true`, disables it otherwise. Note that the preferred way for
controlling this setting is xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#metrics#metrics-configuration[Metrics Configuration].
When it is `true` you can monitor metrics of the clients that are connected to your Hazelcast 
cluster, using Hazelcast Management Center. See
xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:monitor-clients.adoc[here] for more information.

|`hazelcast.client.metrics.jmx.enabled`
| true
| bool
| Enables exposing the collected xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#metrics[metrics] over JMX if set to `true`, disables it otherwise. Note that
the preferred way for controlling this setting is xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#metrics#metrics-configuration[Metrics Configuration].

|`hazelcast.client.operation.backup.timeout.millis`
|5000
|int
|If an operation has sync backups, this property specifies how long the invocation will wait for acks from the backup replicas.
If acks are not received from some backups, there will not be any rollback on other successful replicas.

|`hazelcast.client.operation.fail.on.indeterminate.state`
|false
|bool
|When this configuration is enabled, if an operation has sync backups and acks are not received from backup replicas
in time, or the member which owns primary replica of the target partition leaves the cluster, then the invocation fails
with `IndeterminateOperationStateException`. However, even if the invocation fails,
there will not be any rollback on other successful replicas.

|`hazelcast.client.response.thread.count`
|2
|int
|Number of the response threads.
By default, there are two response threads; this gives stable and good performance.
If set to 0, the response threads are bypassed and the response handling is done
on the I/O threads. Under certain conditions this can give a higher throughput, but
setting to 0 should be regarded as an experimental feature.
If set to 0, the IO_OUTPUT_THREAD_COUNT is really going to matter because the
inbound thread will have more work to do. By default when TLS is not enabled,
there is just one inbound thread.

|`hazelcast.client.response.thread.dynamic`
|true
|bool
|Enables dynamic switching between processing the responses on the I/O threads and offloading the response threads.
Under certain conditions (single threaded clients) processing on the I/O
thread can increase the performance because useless handover to the response
thread is removed. Also the response thread is not created until it is needed.
Especially for ephemeral clients, reducing the threads can lead to
increased performance and reduced memory usage.

|`hazelcast.client.shuffle.member.list`
|true
|string
|The client shuffles the given member list to prevent all the clients to connect
to the same member when this property is `true`. When it is set to `false`,
the client tries to connect to the members in the given order.

NOTE: Not supported by {java-client-new}.

|`hazelcast.client.connectivity.logging.delay.seconds`
|10
|int
|Delay in seconds after which the client logs connectivity statistics after member connection changes.
If a member connection state changes before the delay period has elapsed, the delay is reset.
The delay reduces noise from frequent connection updates that
can occur in bursts. Note that only the last connectivity view will be
logged when the task is run after this delay.

|`hazelcast.client.statistics.enabled`
|false
|bool
|If set to `true`, it enables collecting the client statistics and sending them to the cluster.
This property is deprecated, use `hazelcast.client.metrics.enabled` instead. 
If both are configured, this one is ignored.
Note that since this is replaced with `hazelcast.client.metrics.enabled`, the default behavior
is also changed: it is enabled by default.

|`hazelcast.client.statistics.period.seconds`
|3
|int
|Period in seconds the client statistics are collected and sent to the cluster.
This property is deprecated, use `hazelcast.client.metrics.collection.frequency` instead. 
The value set here is used as `hazelcast.client.metrics.collection.frequency`.
If both are configured, this one is ignored.
|===

== Advanced configuration
=== Declarative configuration

You can configure the client declaratively (XML), programmatically (API), or
using client system properties.

For declarative configuration, the client checks the following places for the client configuration file:

* **System property**: The client first checks if the `hazelcast.client.config` system property is
set to a file path e.g. `-Dhazelcast.client.config=C:/myhazelcast.xml`.
* **Classpath**: If the configuration file is not set as a system property, the client checks the classpath for the `hazelcast-client.xml` file.

If the client does not find a configuration file, it starts with the default configuration
(`hazelcast-client-default.xml`) from the `hazelcast.jar` library.

TIP: Before changing the configuration file, try using the default configuration as a first step. The default configuration should be fine for most environments but you can always consider a custom configuration if it doesn't fit your requirements.

If you want to define your own configuration file to create a `Config` object, you can do this using:

* `Config cfg = new XmlClientConfigBuilder(xmlFileName).build();`
* `Config cfg = new XmlClientConfigBuilder(inputStream).build();`

// are these just examples? is this section complete? Not programmatic config removed as covered previously
=== Client load balancer
`LoadBalancer` enables you to send operations to one of a number of endpoints (members).
Its main purpose is to determine the next `member`, if queried. You can use the `com.hazelcast.client.LoadBalancer` interface to apply different load balancing policies.

For <<client-cluster-routing-modes, Client cluster routing modes>>, the behaviour is as follows:

* If set to `ALL_MEMBERS` only the non key-based operations are routed to the endpoint returned by the `LoadBalancer`
* If set to `SINGLE_MEMBER`, `LoadBalancer` is ignored
* If set to `MULTI_MEMBER`, best effort is made to route operations to the required member. If this can't be done for any reason, operations are routed as defined by the `LoadBalancer`

NOTE: If you are using smart or unisocket client operation modes, see https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.4/clients/java#configuring-client-load-balancer[previous documentation on this topic].

[[client-serialization-configuration]]
=== Configure serialization

For client side serialization, use the Hazelcast configuration.
For more information, see xref:serialization:serialization.adoc[Serialization].

[[configuring-reliable-topic-at-client-side]]
=== Configure reliable topic on client side

Normally when a client uses a Hazelcast data structure,
that structure is configured on the member side and the client uses that configuration.
For the Reliable Topic structure, which is backed by Ringbuffer, you need to configure it on the client side instead. The class used for this configuration is `ClientReliableTopicConfig`.

Here is an example programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/clients/ExampleRTClient.java[tag=rtclient]
----

When you create a Reliable Topic structure on your client, a Ringbuffer
(with the same name as the Reliable Topic) is automatically created on the member side,
with the default configuration. See the xref:data-structures:ringbuffer.adoc[Configuring Ringbuffer section] for the defaults.
You can edit that configuration according to your needs.

You can also declaratively configure a Reliable Topic structure on the client side, as the following declarative code example shows:

      topic-overload-policy: BLOCK
      read-batch-size: 10
----

=== Configure client connection retry

When a client is disconnected from the cluster, or is trying to connect to a cluster
for the first time, it searches for new connections. You can configure the frequency
of the connection attempts and client shutdown behavior using
`ConnectionRetryConfig` (programmatic) or `connection-retry` (declarative).

==== Programmatic Configuration

ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
ClientConnectionStrategyConfig connectionStrategyConfig = config.getConnectionStrategyConfig();
ConnectionRetryConfig connectionRetryConfig = connectionStrategyConfig.getConnectionRetryConfig();
connectionRetryConfig.setInitialBackoffMillis(1000)
                     .setMaxBackoffMillis(60000)

                     .setJitter(0.2);
----

The following are configuration element descriptions:

* `initial-backoff-millis`: Specifies how long to wait (backoff), in milliseconds, after the first failure before retrying.
The default value is 1000 ms.
* `max-backoff-millis`: Specifies the upper limit for the backoff in milliseconds.
The default value is 30000 ms.
* `multiplier`: Factor to multiply the backoff after a failed retry.
The default value is 1.05.
* `cluster-connect-timeout-millis`: Timeout value in milliseconds for the client to give up
connecting to the current cluster. The default value is `-1`, i.e. infinite.
For the default value, client will not stop trying to
connect to the target cluster (infinite timeout). If the failover client is used
with the default value of this configuration element, the failover client will try
to connect alternative clusters after 120000 ms (2 minutes). For any other value,
both the client and the failover client will use this as it is.
* `jitter`: Specifies how much to randomize backoff periods. The default value is 0.

The pseudo-code is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
 begin_time = getCurrentTime()
 current_backoff_millis = INITIAL_BACKOFF_MILLIS
 while (TryConnect(connectionTimeout)) != SUCCESS) {
    if (getCurrentTime() - begin_time >= CLUSTER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS) {
         // Give up to connecting to the current cluster and switch to another if exists.
         // For the default values, CLUSTER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS is infinite for the
         // client and equal to the 120000 ms (2 minutes) for the failover client.
    }
    Sleep(current_backoff_millis + UniformRandom(-JITTER * current_backoff_millis, JITTER * current_backoff_millis))
    current_backoff = Min(current_backoff_millis * MULTIPLIER, MAX_BACKOFF_MILLIS)
  }
----

`TryConnect` tries to connect to any member that the client knows,
and the connection timeout applies for each connection. For more information, see
<<set-connection-timeout, Set connection timeout>>.


=== Use High-Density Memory Store with Java Client
[navy]*Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}*

If you have [navy]*Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}*, the client's Near Cache
can benefit from the High-Density Memory Store.

Let's consider the Java client's Near Cache configuration
(see the <<configure-client-near-cache, Configure Client Near Cache section>>)
**without** High-Density Memory Store:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <near-cache name="MENU">
        <eviction size="2000" eviction-policy="LFU"/>
        <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>
        <max-idle-seconds>0</max-idle-seconds>
        <invalidate-on-change>true</invalidate-on-change>
        <in-memory-format>OBJECT</in-memory-format>
    </near-cache>
    ...
</hazelcast-client>
----

You can configure this Near Cache to use Hazelcast's High-Density Memory Store
by setting the in-memory format to NATIVE. See the following configuration example:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <near-cache>
        <eviction size="1000" max-size-policy="ENTRY_COUNT" eviction-policy="LFU"/>
        <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>
        <max-idle-seconds>0</max-idle-seconds>
        <invalidate-on-change>true</invalidate-on-change>
        <in-memory-format>NATIVE</in-memory-format>
    </near-cache>
</hazelcast-client>
----

The `<eviction>` element has the following attributes:

* `size`: Maximum size (entry count) of the Near Cache.
* `max-size-policy`: Maximum size policy for eviction of the Near Cache.
Available values are as follows:
** ENTRY_COUNT: Maximum entry count per member.
** USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE: Maximum used native memory size in megabytes.
** USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE: Maximum used native memory percentage.
** FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE: Minimum free native memory size to trigger cleanup.
** FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE: Minimum free native memory percentage to trigger cleanup.
* `eviction-policy`: Eviction policy configuration. The default value is NONE.
Available values are as follows:
** NONE: No items are evicted and the `size` property is ignored.
You can still combine it with time-to-live-seconds.
** LRU: Least Recently Used.
** LFU: Least Frequently Used.

Keep in mind that you should have already enabled the High-Density Memory Store
usage for your client, using the `<native-memory>` element in the client's configuration.

See the xref:storage:high-density-memory.adoc[High-Density Memory Store section]
for more information about Hazelcast's High-Density Memory Store feature.





[[blue-green-deployment-and-disaster-recovery]]

=== Blue-Green Deployment
[[blue-green-mechanism]]
[blue]*Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}*

Blue-green deployment refers to a client connection technique that reduces system downtime by deploying two mirrored clusters: blue (active) and green (idle). One of these clusters is running in production while the other is on standby.

Using the blue-green mechanism, clients can connect to another cluster automatically when they are blacklisted from their currently connected cluster. See the xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:monitor-clients.adoc#changing-cluster-client-filtering[Hazelcast Management Center Reference Manual] for information about blacklisting the clients.

The client's behavior after this disconnection depends on its
<<java-client-connection-strategy, `reconnect-mode`>>.
The following are the options when you are using the blue-green mechanism, i.e.,
you have alternative clusters for your clients to connect:

* If `reconnect-mode` is set to `ON`, the client changes the cluster and
blocks the invocations while doing so.
* If `reconnect-mode` is set to `ASYNC`, the client changes the cluster
in the background and throws `ClientOfflineException` while doing so.
* If `reconnect-mode` is set to `OFF`, the client does not change the cluster; it shuts down immediately.

NOTE: Here it could be the case that the whole cluster is restarted.
In this case, the members in the restarted cluster
reject the client's connection request, since the client is trying to connect to the old cluster.
So, the client needs to search for a new cluster, if available and
according to the blue-green configuration (see the following configuration related sections in this section).

Consider the following notes for the blue-green mechanism (also valid for the disaster
recovery mechanism described in the next section):

* When a client disconnects from a cluster and
connects to a new one the `InitialMemberEvent` and `CLIENT_CHANGED_CLUSTER` events are fired.
* When switching clusters, the client reuses its UUID.
* The client's listener service re-registers its listeners on the new cluster;
the listener service opens a new connection to all members in the current
<<client-network, member list>> and registers the listeners for each connection.
* The client's Near Caches and Continuous Query Caches are cleared when
the client joins a new cluster successfully.
* If the new cluster's partition size is different, the client is rejected by the cluster.
The client is not able to connect to a cluster with different partition count.
* The state of any running job on the original cluster will be undefined. * Streaming jobs may continue running on the original cluster if the cluster is still alive and the switching happened due to a network problem. If you try to query the state of the job using the Job interface, you’ll get a `JobNotFoundException`.

=== Disaster Recovery Mechanism

When one of your clusters is gone due to a failure, the connection between
your clients and members in that cluster is gone too.
When a client is disconnected because of a failure in the cluster,
it first tries to reconnect to the same cluster.

The client's behavior after this disconnection depends on its
<<java-client-connection-strategy, `reconnect-mode`>>, and it has the same options
that are described in the above section (Blue-Green Mechanism).

If you have provided alternative clusters for your clients to connect,
the client tries to connect to those alternative clusters (depending on the `reconnect-mode`).

When a failover starts, i.e., the client is disconnected and was configured
to connect to alternative clusters, the current <<client-network, member list>> is not considered;
the client cuts all the connections before attempting to connect to a new cluster and tries the clusters as configured.
See the below configuration related sections.

=== Reconnect order for clusters

The order of clusters that the client will try to reconnect
in a blue-green or disaster recovery scenario is decided by
the order of the cluster declarations defined in the client configuration.

Every time the client disconnects from a cluster and cannot connect back to the same cluster,
this list is iterated over. The `try-count` configuration element limits the number of iterations before the client shuts down.

As an example, assume that your `hazelcast-client-failover` XML or YAML file defines the following order:

* `client-config1`
* `client-config2`
* `client-config3`

Which means you have three alternative clusters.

    - client-config3.yaml
----
====

If the client is disconnected from the cluster configured in `client-config2`, the cluster will try to connect to the next cluster in the list, which is `client-config3`. 
If the client fails to connect to this cluster then the `try-count` is incremented, and the client tries to connect to the next alternative cluster, which in this case is `client-config1` (because it has reached the end of the list and returns to the start). This iteration continues until either the client successfully connects to a cluster or the `try-count` limit is reached. If the `try-count` is reached without connecting, the client shuts down. 

// check try-count logic

== Failures
=== Client deadline failure detector

_Deadline Failure Detector_ uses an absolute timeout for missing/lost heartbeats.
After timeout, a member is considered as crashed/unavailable and marked as suspected.

_Deadline Failure Detector_ has two configuration properties:

* `hazelcast.client.heartbeat.interval`: This is the interval at which client sends
heartbeat messages to members.
* `hazelcast.client.heartbeat.timeout`: This is the timeout which defines when
a cluster member is suspected, because it has not sent any response back to client requests.

NOTE: The value of `hazelcast.client.heartbeat.interval` should be smaller than
that of `hazelcast.client.heartbeat.timeout`. In addition, the value of system property
xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc#client-max-no[`hazelcast.client.max.no.heartbeat.seconds`], which is set on the member side,
should be larger than that of `hazelcast.client.heartbeat.interval`.

The following is a declarative example showing how you can configure the Deadline Failure Detector
for your client (in the client's configuration XML file, e.g., `hazelcast-client.xml`):

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <properties>
        <property name="hazelcast.client.heartbeat.timeout">60000</property>
        <property name="hazelcast.client.heartbeat.interval">5000</property>
    </properties>
    ...
</hazelcast-client>
----

----
hazelcast-client:
  properties
    hazelcast.client.heartbeat.timeout: 60000
    hazelcast.client.heartbeat.interval: 5000
----
====

And, the following is the equivalent programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig config = ...;
config.setProperty("hazelcast.client.heartbeat.timeout", "60000");
config.setProperty("hazelcast.client.heartbeat.interval", "5000");
[...]
----

=== Client ping failure detector

In addition to the Deadline Failure Detector, the Ping Failure Detector may be configured on your client.
Please note that this detector is disabled by default. The Ping Failure Detector
operates at Layer 3 of the OSI protocol and provides much quicker and more deterministic
detection of hardware and other lower level events.
When the JVM process has enough permissions to create RAW sockets, the implementation
chooses to rely on ICMP Echo requests. This is preferred.

If there are not enough permissions, it can be configured to fallback on attempting
a TCP Echo on port 7. In the latter case, both a successful connection or an explicit rejection
is treated as "Host is Reachable". Or, it can be forced to use only RAW sockets.
This is not preferred as each call creates a heavyweight socket and moreover the Echo service is typically disabled.

For the Ping Failure Detector to rely **only** on the ICMP Echo requests,
the following criteria need to be met:

* Supported OS: as of Java 1.8 only Linux/Unix environments are supported.
* The Java executable must have the `cap_net_raw` capability.
* The file `ld.conf` must be edited to overcome the rejection by the dynamic
linker when loading libs from untrusted paths.
* ICMP Echo Requests must not be blocked by the receiving hosts.

The details of these requirements are explained in the
xref:clusters:failure-detector-configuration.adoc#requirements-and-linuxunix-configuration[Requirements section] of
Hazelcast members' xref:clusters:failure-detector-configuration.adoc#ping-failure-detector[Ping Failure Detector].

If any of the above criteria isn't met, then `isReachable` will always
fall back on TCP Echo attempts on port 7.

An example declarative configuration to use the Ping Failure Detector is
as follows (in the client's configuration XML file, e.g., `hazelcast-client.xml`):

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]

<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <network>
        <icmp-ping enabled="true">
            <timeout-milliseconds>1000</timeout-milliseconds>
            <interval-milliseconds>1000</interval-milliseconds>
            <ttl>255<ttl>
            <echo-fail-fast-on-startup>false</echo-fail-fast-on-startup>
            <max-attempts>2</max-attempts>
        </icmp-ping>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast-client>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  network:
    icmp-ping:
      enabled: false
      timeout-milliseconds: 1000
      interval-milliseconds: 1000
      ttl: 255
      echo-fail-fast-on-startup: false
      max-attempts: 2
----
====

And, the equivalent programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig config = ...;

ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig();
ClientIcmpPingConfig clientIcmpPingConfig = networkConfig.getClientIcmpPingConfig();
clientIcmpPingConfig.setIntervalMilliseconds(1000)
        .setTimeoutMilliseconds(1000)
        .setTtl(255)
        .setMaxAttempts(2)
        .setEchoFailFastOnStartup(false)
        .setEnabled(true);
----

The following are the descriptions of configuration elements and attributes:

* `enabled`: Enables the legacy ICMP detection mode, works cooperatively with
the existing failure detector and only kicks-in after a pre-defined period
has passed with no heartbeats from a member. Its default value is `false`.
* `timeout-milliseconds`: Number of milliseconds until a ping attempt is
considered failed if there was no reply. Its default value is *1000* milliseconds.
* `max-attempts`: Maximum number of ping attempts before the member gets
suspected by the detector. Its default value is *3*.
* `interval-milliseconds`: Interval, in milliseconds, between each ping attempt.
1000ms (1 sec) is also the minimum interval allowed. Its default value is *1000* milliseconds.
* `ttl`: Maximum number of hops the packets should go through.
Its default value is *255*. You can set to *0* to use your system's default TTL.

In the above example configuration, the Ping Failure Detector attempts 2 pings,
one every second, and waits up to 1 second for each to complete.
If there is no successful ping after 2 seconds, the member gets suspected.

To enforce the xref:clusters:failure-detector-configuration.adoc#requirements-and-linuxunix-configuration[Requirements],
the property `echo-fail-fast-on-startup` can also be set to `true`, in which case Hazelcast fails to start if any of the requirements
isn't met.

Unlike the Hazelcast members, Ping Failure Detector works always in parallel with
Deadline Failure Detector on the clients.
Below is a summary table of all possible configuration combinations of the Ping Failure Detector.

|===
| ICMP| Fail-Fast| Description| Linux| Windows | macOS

=== Java Client Failure Detectors

The client failure detectors are responsible to determine if a member in the cluster is unreachable or crashed.
The most important problem in the failure detection is to distinguish
whether a member is still alive but slow, or has crashed.
But according to the famous http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3149.214121[FLP result^],
it is impossible to distinguish a crashed member from a slow one in an asynchronous system.
A workaround to this limitation is to use unreliable failure detectors.
An unreliable failure detector allows a member to suspect that others have failed,
usually based on liveness criteria but it can make mistakes to a certain degree.

Hazelcast Java client has two built-in failure detectors: Deadline Failure Detector and
Ping Failure Detector. These client failure detectors work independently of
the member failure detectors, e.g., you do not need to enable the member failure detectors
to benefit from the client ones.
