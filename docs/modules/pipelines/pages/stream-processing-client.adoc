== Step 1. Set Up the Project

First, you need to setup a Java project that you can later package and submit to a Hazelcast cluster.

. Check that you have Maven installed.
+
```bash
mvn -v
```
+
If Maven is installed, you should see some information about the Maven installation, which looks similar to the following:
+
```
Apache Maven 3.8.1 (05c21c65bdfed0f71a2f2ada8b84da59348c4c5d)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.1/libexec
Java version: 16.0.1, vendor: Homebrew, runtime: /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/16.0.1/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
Default locale: en_GB, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.15.7", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

. Create the following structure in a project directory of your choice.
+
----
📄 pom.xml
📂 src
  📂 main
    📂 java
       📂 org
          📂 example
             📄 EvenNumberStream.java
----

. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file to set your project’s name, version, and its dependencies on external libraries such as Hazelcast.
+
Replace the `${jdk.version}` placeholder with your JDK version.
+

== Step 2. Build your Stream Processing Pipeline

With Hazelcast, you can specify data processing steps, using the Java Jet API. This API defines a series of tasks that can be submitted to a Hazelcast cluster as a job.

The general pattern of a data processing pipeline is to read data from a data source, process (or transform) it, and write the results to a data sink. You can visualize these steps as a linear process:

readFromSource -> transform -> writeToSink

In this step, you create a pipeline that reads a stream of incrementing numbers from a test data source and prints only even numbers, using the console as a sink.

. Add the following to your `EvenNumberStream.java` file.

[source,java]
----
package org.example;

import com.hazelcast.config.Config;
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.Pipeline;
import com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.Sinks;
import com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.test.TestSources;

public class EvenNumberStream {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create(); <1>
    pipeline.readFrom(TestSources.itemStream(10)) <2>
      .withoutTimestamps() <3>
      .filter(event -> event.sequence() % 2 == 0) <4>
      .setName("filter out odd numbers") <5>
      .writeTo(Sinks.logger()); <6>

    HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.bootstrappedInstance(); <7>

    hz.getJet().newJob(pipeline); <8>
  }
}
----

<1> Initialize an empty pipeline.
<2> Read from the dummy data source. Every second, the `itemStream()` method emits 10 `SimpleEvent` objects that contain an increasing sequence number.
<3> Tell Hazelcast that you do not plan on using timestamps to process the data. Timestamps are useful for time-sensitive processes such as aggregating streaming data. In this example, you aren't aggregating data.
<4> Filter out any even numbers from the stream. The `filter()` method receives the `SimpleEvent` objects from the dummy source. 
<5> Set the name of this processing stage. Naming a processing stage makes it easier to recognize in the <<step-4-monitor-your-jobs-in-management-center, DAG view>> of Management Center.
<6> Send the result of the streaming process to the console. A pipeline without any sinks is not valid.
<7> Create a bootstrapped Hazelcast member. This bootstrapped member allows you to submit your pipeline as a packaged class to a running cluster, using the xref:pipelines:submitting-jobs.adoc[`newJob()`] method.
<8> Pass your pipeline to the bootstrapped Jet engine.

Each method such as `readFrom()` or `writeTo()` results in a pipeline _stage_. The stage resulting from a `writeTo()` operation is called a
_sink stage_ and you can't attach more stages to it. All other stages are
called _compute stages_ and expect you to attach further stages to them.

== Step 3. Start a Hazelcast Member

In this step, you start a local single-member cluster to which you can submit your pipeline as a job.

[tabs] 
==== 
Docker:: 
+ 
--
. Create a new Docker network called `hazelcast-network`.
+
[source,shell]
----
docker network create hazelcast-network
----
+
Docker networks make it easier for you to connect to your cluster and add other services that need to communicate with your cluster.

. Execute the Docker `run` command to start a member.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    -it \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    --rm \
    -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:{full-version}
----
+
Docker parameters:
+
- `-it`: Starts an interactive session, allowing you to stop the member with kbd:[Ctrl+C].
- `--rm`: Tells Docker to remove the container from its local cache after it exits.
- `--network`: Allows you to connect to clusters, using an alias.
- `-p`: All member containers must publish port 5701 under a different host machine port.

== Step 4. Submit your Job to the Member

After building a pipeline, you can deploy it to your member by packaging the code into a JAR file and submitting it to the member as a job. After you submit the JAR file to the cluster, it will optimize the execution plan and start running the job for you.

. Package your Java code into a JAR file.
+
```bash
mvn package
```

. From the Hazelcast home directory execute the `hazelcast submit` command.
+
[tabs] 
==== 
Docker:: 
+ 
--
Replace the following placeholders:

- $PATH_TO_TARGET: The absolute path to your `target` directory.
- $MEMBER_IP: The IP address of the member to which to submit the job.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -it --network hazelcast-network -v $PATH_TO_TARGET:/jars --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:{full-version} hz-cli -t $MEMBER_IP submit -c org.example.EvenNumberStream /jars/hz-example-0.1.0.jar
----

In the console of your Hazelcast member, you should see that a new job has been submitted and it's running on your cluster.
--
Binary:: 
+ 
--
Replace the `$PATH_TO_JAR_FILE` placeholder with the absolute or relative path to your packaged JAR file.

.Mac and Linux
[source,shell]
----
bin/hz-cli submit --class org.example.EvenNumberStream $PATH_TO_JAR_FILE
----

.Windows 
[source,shell]
----
bin/hz-start.bat submit --class org.example.EvenNumberStream $PATH_TO_JAR_FILE
----
--
====
+
TIP: To avoid the need to specify your main class in the `hazelcast submit` command, you should also set the `Main-Class` attribute in the `MANIFEST.MF`.

. To see a list of running jobs on your cluster, execute the `list-jobs` command:
+
[tabs] 
==== 
Docker:: 
+ 
--
```bash
docker run -it --network hazelcast-network hazelcast/hazelcast hz-cli -t $MEMBER_IP list-jobs
```
--
Binary:: 
+ 
--
.Mac and Linux
[source,shell]
----
bin/hz-cli list-jobs
----

.Windows 
[source,shell]
----
bin/hz-start.bat list-jobs
----
--
====
+
You should see the following:
+
```
ID                  STATUS             SUBMISSION TIME         NAME
03de-e38d-3480-0001 RUNNING            2020-02-09T16:30:26.843 N/A
```
+
Each job has a unique cluster-wide ID. You can use this ID to manage the job.
+
NOTE: A job with a streaming source will run indefinitely until explicitly canceled or the cluster is shut down. Even if you kill the client application, the job keeps running on the cluster.

== Step 4. Monitor your Jobs in Management Center

With Management Center, you can monitor the status of your jobs and manage the lifecycle of existing jobs in your cluster.

. Start Management Center.

. In a web browser, go to localhost:8080 and enable dev mode.

image:getting-started:mc-dev-mode.png[Enabling dev mode in Management center]

. Enter your cluster's name (`dev`) and IP address.
+
image:getting-started:mc-active-cluster.png[An active cluster in Management Center]

. In the left menu of Management Center, go to *Streaming* > *Jobs*.
+
You should see that your job is running.
+
image:getting-started:mc-job-status.png[A job that is running on the cluster]

. Click the job ID to open a detailed view of your job.
+
You should see a graph (DAG) in the center of the page. This graph is a visual representation of how Hazelcast optimizes your jobs for distributed execution. You can learn more about this concept in xref:architecture:distributed-computing.adoc[].
+
TIP: You can click any node on the graph to see more information about how your cluster is executing it.
+
image:getting-started:mc-dag.gif[Clicking a node on the graph opens a modal window that displays its data processing details]

. To cancel your job, click *Cancel*.
+
image:getting-started:mc-cancel-job.png[Cancel button at the top of the Jobs page]
+
In the console of the Hazelcast member, you should see that the job is canceled as well as the time it was started and how long it ran for.
+
```
Execution of job '062d-d578-9240-0001', execution 062d-d578-df80-0001 got terminated, reason=java.util.concurrent.CancellationException
