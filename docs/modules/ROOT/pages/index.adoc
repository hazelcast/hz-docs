Welcome to the documentation for Hazelcast Platform, the leading in-memory data grid and compute platform for building real-time applications. 

Hazelcast Platform combinesa a fast data store and powerful stream processing into a single platform, eliminating latency moving data between databases and processing. It enables you to build high-performance, scalable, and resilient applications that can handle large volumes of data with low latency.

Hazelcast offers xref:getting-started:get-started-enterprise.adoc[{enterprise-product-name}] and xref:getting-started:get-started-docker.adoc[{open-source-product-name}] versions of Hazelcast Platform with a range of deployment options, including Docker and Kubernetes. You can get started with either version by following the quickstarts below.

Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name} is a licensed product that extends the {open-source-product-name} to provide many additional xref:getting-started:editions.adoc#key-features-and-benefits[features and benefits] for production environments, including regular patch releases and a xref:getting-started:support.adoc[Support] subscription. 

Hazelcast is implemented in Java (with choice of embedded or client/server mode) and has xref:clients:client-overview.adoc[clients] for Java, C++, .NET, REST, Python, Go and Node.js. Hazelcast also speaks Memcache and REST protocols.
