= Configuring WAN Replication
:page-enterprise: true

WAN Replication is defined and configured using the `wan-replication` configuration
element as can be seen in the above examples.

In this section you learn how to establish the connection between WAN
replicated clusters and configure the behavior of WAN replication mechanism.

For establishing the connection, you have the following options:

* using static endpoints (when you want to provide the IP addresses of target Hazelcast members)
* using Discovery SPI (when you want to target Hazelcast members on various cloud infrastructures)
+
You can use only one of these (not both) when defining a single WAN publisher.

The examples in this section uses Hazelcast's built-in WAN replication implementation.
This implementation meets most of your WAN replication needs and is configured using the
`batch-publisher` element, which you will see in the below examples. Hazelcast also allows you
to build your own implementation; see the xref:advanced-features.adoc#defining-custom-wr[Advanced Features section]
for details in case you need more custom configurations.

The default settings for WAN Replication configuration suit most use cases. If, however, you have specific needs or if you
would like to fine-tune the behavior of WAN Replication for your application, see the
xref:tuning.adoc[Fine-Tuning WAN Replication section].

See also

* xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc#setting-up-wan-endpoints-configuration[Setting Up WAN Endpoints Configuration]
for the examples that use advanced network configuration to set up, for example, security features such as
TLS and mutual authentication for your WAN replicated clusters
* <<keeping-wan-connections-alive-across-firewalls, Keeping WAN Connections Alive Across Firewalls>>
to see the options on how to keep a connection between WAN replicated clusters alive in certain cases such as having a strict firewall.

Let's see how we configure a simple WAN replication using the static endpoints and Discovery SPI, and
then let's see the configuration details of Hazelcast's built-in WAN replication implementation.

[[wanbatchreplication-static-endpoints]]
== Using the Static Endpoints

This is most suitable when the endpoints have static IP addresses that will not change for the duration of the lifecycle
of the source cluster. You will then list these addresses in the WAN publisher configuration and WAN Replication will try
to keep a stable connection to each of those.

By default, the static endpoints discovery strategy includes health checks that track and periodically probe non-responsive
endpoints for liveness. This mechanism keeps endpoints that have failed (due to connection timeouts or other exceptions)
out of the active set of endpoints used for replication, avoiding unnecessary delays in replication caused by waiting for
timeouts. For more information, including how to disable health checking for endpoints, see the
xref:tuning.adoc[Fine-Tuning WAN Replication section].

Below is an example of declarative configuration of WAN Replication between two Hazelcast clusters. Here, we show the
configuration that is needed on the source ("active") cluster. In most cases, the target ("passive") cluster does not
need any kind of configuration and configuring the source cluster is enough for WAN Replication to function normally.

Here, we show the simplest working configurations to replicate to a target cluster with the cluster-name `london`.

We can see that we have configured the map named `replicatedMap` and cache named `replicatedCache` to
replicate to the cluster named `london` on two endpoints - `10.3.5.1:5701, 10.3.5.2:5701`. The `london` cluster
might have more members than these two but only these two will receive WAN events and forward them to other
members in the `london` cluster or to other clusters if WAN event forwarding is enabled.
Please notice that the WAN Replication configuration is referenced in map and cache configuration by name, here
`london-wan-rep`.

The default settings for WAN Replication will suit most use cases. If, however, you have specific needs or if you
would like to fine-tune the behavior of WAN Replication for your application, please refer to the
xref:tuning.adoc[Fine-Tuning WAN Replication section] for more information.

[[wanbatchreplication-discovery-spi]]
== Using the Discovery SPI

In addition to defining target cluster endpoints with static IP addresses,
you can configure WAN to work with the Discovery SPI and determine the endpoint IP addresses at runtime.
It may be suitable when you don't know the list of static IP addresses of the target cluster at
startup time or in cases when the list of available target endpoints is subject to change during the lifecycle of the
source cluster.

In relation to the above, using the Discovery SPI allows you to use WAN with endpoints on various cloud
infrastructures (such as Amazon EC2 or GCP Compute) where
the IP address is not known in advance. Typically, you use a readily available Discovery SPI plugin such as
xref:deploy:deploying-on-aws.adoc[Hazelcast AWS discovery plugin^],
xref:deploy:deploying-on-azure.adoc[Hazelcast Azure discovery plugin^],
xref:deploy:deploying-on-gcp.adoc[Hazelcast GCP discovery plugin^], or similar.
You can store the list of IP addresses in those infrastructures and use these plugins
to read from that list.

For more advanced cases, you can provide your own xref:extending-hazelcast:discovery-spi.adoc[Discovery SPI] implementation with custom logic for
determining the WAN target endpoints such as looking up the endpoints in some service registry or even
reading the endpoint addresses from a file.

NOTE: When using the Discovery SPI, WAN always connects to the public address of the members returned by
the Discovery SPI implementation. This is opposite to the cluster membership mechanism using
the Discovery SPI where a member connects to a different member in the same cluster through its private address.
Should you prefer for WAN to use the private address of the discovered member as well,
please use the `use-endpoint-private-address` publisher element, described in the following paragraphs.

The following is an example of setting up the WAN replication with the AWS discovery plugin.

The `hz-port` property defines the port or the port range on which the target endpoint is running.
The default port range 5701-5708 is used if this property is not defined.
This is needed because the Amazon API which the AWS plugin uses does not provide
the port on which Hazelcast is running, only the IP address. For some other Discovery SPI implementations,
this might not be necessary and it might discover the port as well, e.g., by looking up in a service registry.

The other properties are the same as when using the `aws` element. In case of AWS discovery you can configure
the WAN replication using the `aws` element. You may use either the `discovery-strategies` or `aws`
element, but not both at the same time.

[[wanbatchreplication-implementation]]
== Using the Built-In WAN Batch Publisher 

Hazelcast offers the built-in WAN batch publisher implementation for WAN replication.

As you see in the above configuration examples, this implementation is specified simply by using
the `batch-publisher` element (in the declarative configuration) or the `WanBatchPublisherConfig`
class (in the programmatic configuration) when defining a WAN replication publisher.

The WAN batch publisher transmits WAN events (map and cache updates) between clusters in batches. It waits until:

* a pre-defined number of replication events are generated, (see the xref:tuning.adoc#batch-size[Batch Size section])
* or a pre-defined amount of time is passed (see the xref:tuning.adoc#batch-maximum-delay[Batch Maximum Delay section]).

Here is a declarative example on using and configuring `batch-publisher`:

Above, you notice that we have configured the instance to replicate a map and a cache to a target cluster
with the cluster name `london`. WAN Replication will check that this cluster name matches during connection
establishment to each endpoint. This does not serve as a security measure though. This serves only to prevent
misconfiguration where the source cluster would mistakenly replicate to the wrong cluster and as an attempt to
detect and prevent loops where the same WAN event would be infinitely forwarded between the same clusters.

The `wan-replication` configuration element defines a single WAN replication scheme. Hazelcast maps and caches
are configured to replicate to a single WAN replication scheme and different maps and different caches can be
configured to replicate to different WAN replication schemes. Simply put, a WAN replication scheme may be viewed
as several target clusters and different Hazelcast structures can replicate to different target clusters
simultaneously. As such, a single WAN replication scheme can contain multiple WAN replication publishers.
It has the following essential sub-elements and attributes:

* `name`: Name of your WAN replication scheme. This name is referenced in IMap or ICache configuration when you want
to enable WAN Replication for these data structures (using the element `wan-replication-ref` in the configuration
of IMap or ICache).
* `batch-publisher`: Enables use of a WAN publisher which uses the built-in WAN replication implementation.
It defines how to connect to the target cluster and how WAN events are sent to a specific target
endpoint. As mentioned above, just before the configuration example, the target endpoints can be a different cluster
defined by static IPs or discovered using a cloud discovery mechanism.

The `batch-publisher` has the following sub-elements:

* `cluster-name`: Sets the cluster name used as an endpoint cluster name for authentication
on the target endpoint. If there is no separate publisher ID element defined, this cluster name
is also used as a WAN publisher ID. This ID is then used for identifying the publisher in a
WAN replication scheme. It is mandatory to set this attribute.
* `publisher-id`: Sets the publisher ID used to identify the publisher in a WAN replication scheme.
Setting this ID may be useful when the `wan-replication` element contains multiple WAN publishers and the
cluster names are not unique for all the WAN replication publishers in a single WAN replication scheme.
It is optional to set this attribute. If this ID is not specified, the `cluster-name` is used as a publisher ID.
* `target-endpoints`: IP addresses and ports of the cluster members for which the WAN replication is implemented.
It is enough to specify some of the member IP/ports available in the target cluster, i.e., you don’t need to
provide the IP/ports of all members in there. WAN does not perform the discovery of other members in the target cluster;
it only expects that the IP addresses you provide are available.
* `sync`: Configuration for the WAN sync mechanism. See the xref:advanced-features.adoc#synchronizing-wan-clusters[Synchronizing WAN Clusters section].
* `discovery-strategies`: Set its `enabled` attribute to true for discovery in various cloud infrastructures.
You can define multiple discovery strategies using the `discovery-strategy` sub-element and its elements.
See the <<wanbatchreplication-discovery-spi, Using the Discovery SPI section>> for this and the below elements.
* `aws`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Amazon EC2 discovery plugin.
* `gcp`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Google cloud platform discovery plugin.
* `azure`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Microsoft Azure discovery plugin.
* `kubernetes`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Kubernetes discovery plugin.
* `eureka`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Eureka discovery plugin.

Using this configuration, the cluster replicates to a cluster with the name `london`.
The `london` cluster should have a similar configuration if you want to run in Active-Active mode.

You can achieve various WAN topologies using different configurations on different clusters. For instance,
if the New York and London cluster configurations contain the `wan-replication` element and the Tokyo cluster
does not, it might mean that the New York and London clusters are active endpoints and Tokyo is a passive endpoint.

== Keeping WAN Connections Alive Across Firewalls

You can specify keep-alive socket options to prevent the connections over WAN to be dropped due to inactivity.
This may be caused by the firewalls blocking the idle connections after some time.

To keep the connections alive in these cases, you should set up the socket options **either** in the source **or** target cluster, as depicted below.
