= Updating or Reloading Dynamic Configuration in REST
:description: You can use the /config/update and /config/reload REST endpoints to add dynamic configuration for some supported features at runtime.
:page-enterprise: true

include::clients:partial$rest-deprecation.adoc[]

You can use the `/config/update` and `/config/reload` REST endpoints to add xref:dynamic-config.adoc[dynamic configuration] for some xref:dynamic-config.adoc#options[supported features] at runtime:

- <<update, `/config/update`>>: Send a configuration file in the request parameter.
- <<reload, `/config/reload`>>: Edit an existing configuration file that a member has already loaded and then reload it.

Changes are broadcast to the entire cluster. If you reload the configuration, you only need to edit one member's configuration to affect the whole cluster.

NOTE: You cannot send configuration changes through lite members.

NOTE: For security reasons, xref:configuring-declaratively.adoc#variables[configuration variables] and templating are disabled by default in the {enterprise-product-name} REST API. You can enable them by starting members with the system property `-Dhazelcast.rest.allow.config.templating=true`.

== Before you Begin

The REST API and the `CLUSTER_WRITE` endpoint group must be enabled on your cluster. See xref:maintain-cluster:rest-api.adoc[].

[[reload]]
== Editing and Reloading a Configuration File

. Make your changes to the file that stores your member's configuration. For example, you may want to configure a new map with a backup count.
+
NOTE: Keep all existing configuration the same. You can only add new configuration blocks. To see what you can add see xref:dynamic-config.adoc#options[Supported Dynamic Configuration Changes]

The member sends back a <<response, response>>.

[[update]]
== Updating Configuration

To update a member's configuration, without editing the configuration file, use the `/config/update` endpoint.

This endpoint takes a URL encoded string of either YAML or XML as parameter. You only need to pass the new configuration blocks that you want to add with the `hazelcast` root. All existing configuration settings remain unchanged. However, you can include existing configuration blocks as well. The member will just ignore them.

NOTE: If you are using the XML file format, make sure to provide the `xmlns` attribute: `<hazelcast xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config"></hazelcast>` instead of `<hazelcast></hazelcast>`.

NOTE: For security reasons, xref:configuring-declaratively.adoc#variables[configuration variables] and templating are disabled by default in the {enterprise-product-name} REST API. You can enable them by starting members with the system property `-Dhazelcast.rest.allow.config.templating=true`.

For example, when a member has configuration for `map-1` and `map-2` in its configuration file, you can pass in a new configuration block for `map-3` in the following ways: 

- The `hazelcast` root and the new `map-3` configuration block.
- The `hazelcast` root, `map-1` and the new `map-3` configuration block.
- The `hazelcast` root, `map-2` and the new `map-3` configuration block.
- The `hazelcast` root, `map-1`, `map-2` and the new `map-3` configuration block.

The outcome of these dynamic configuration changes is the same: A new configuration block for a map called `map-3`.

NOTE: The configuration string must be URL encoded.

If your cluster has security enabled, send the cluster password in the request.

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data-urlencode "<cluster-name>" --data-urlencode "<cluster-password>" --data-urlencode "
hazelcast:
  map:
    map-3:
      backup-count: 2
" http://localhost:5701/hazelcast/rest/config/update
----

If your cluster does not have security enabled, send the password as an empty string.

[source,shell]

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data-urlencode "<cluster-name>" --data-urlencode "" --data-urlencode "
hazelcast:
  map:
    map-3:
      backup-count: 2
" http://localhost:5701/hazelcast/rest/config/update
----

The member sends back a <<response, response>>.

[[response]]
== Request Response

When a member receives a dynamic configuration request, it checks if the configuration already exists and propagates any new configuration across the following:

- Other members in the cluster.
- Members that may join the cluster later.

You should see the new configuration in the response's `addedConfigs` field:

```json
{"status":"success","message":"Configuration Update successfully finished.","result":{"addedConfigs":[{"sectionName":"map","configName":"new-map"}],"ignoredConfigs":[]}}
```

The REST endpoints are idempotent. If you add a dynamic configuration for a block that already exists, the member will ignore the request and return the change you requested in the `ignoredConfigs` field.

{"status":"success","message":"Configuration Update successfully finished.","result":{"addedConfigs":[],"ignoredConfigs":[{"sectionName":"map","configName":"existing-map"}]}}
