= Get Started with Stream Processing (Client/Server)
:description: This tutorial shows you how to use a Hazelcast cluster as a data processing engine for your client applications. At the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to build a data pipeline in Java and submit it as a job to your Hazelcast cluster.

{description}

== Before You Begin

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

|Prerequisites|Useful resources

|A local Hazelcast cluster (xref:getting-started:install-hazelcast.adoc#choosing-an-application-topology[client/server mode]) and an instance of Management Center running on your local network
|xref:getting-started:get-started-binary.adoc[Start a Local Cluster]
|===

== Step 1. Write your Stream Processing Pipeline

With Hazelcast, you can specify data processing steps, using the Java Jet API. This API defines a series of tasks that can be submitted to a Hazelcast cluster as a job.

The general pattern of a data processing pipeline is to read data from a data source, process (or transform) it, and write the results to a data sink. You can visualize these steps as a linear process:

readFromSource -> transform -> writeToSink

In this step, you create a pipeline that reads a stream of incrementing numbers from a dummy data source and prints only even numbers, using the console as a sink.

. Import the dependencies and create an `App` class.
+
[source,java]
----
import com.hazelcast.config.Config;
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.Pipeline;
import com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.Sinks;
import com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.test.TestSources;

public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  }
}
----

. Write a `buildEvenNumberStreamPipeline()` method for your `App` class:
+
[source,java]
----
private static Pipeline buildEvenNumberStreamPipeline() {
  Pipeline EvenNumberStream = Pipeline.create(); <1>
  EvenNumberStream.readFrom(TestSources.itemStream(10)) <2>
   .withoutTimestamps() <3>
   .filter(event -> event.sequence() % 2 == 0) <4>
   .setName("filter out odd numbers") <5>
   .writeTo(Sinks.logger()); <6>

   return EvenNumberStream;
}
----
+
<1> Initialize an empty pipeline.
<2> Read from the dummy data source. Every 10 seconds, the `itemStream()` method emits `SimpleEvent` objects that contain an increasing sequence number.
<3> Tell Hazelcast that you do not plan on using timestamps to process the data.
<4> Filter out any even numbers from the stream. The `filter()` method receives the `SimpleEvent` objects from the dummy source. 
<5> Set the name of the job that you can use to manage it in the future for tasks such as canceling the job.
<6> Send the result of the streaming process to the console. A pipeline without any sinks is not valid.
+
Each method such as `readFrom()` or `writeTo()` results in a pipeline _stage_. The stage resulting from a `writeTo()` operation is called a
_sink stage_ and you can't attach more stages to it. All other stages are
called _compute stages_ and expect you to attach further stages to them.

. To start the Jet engine, add this code to the bottom of your `main()` method:
+
[source,java]
----
Pipeline evenNumberStream = buildEvenNumberStreamPipeline(); <1>

HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.bootstrappedInstance(); <2>

try {
    hz.getJet().newJob(evenNumberStream); <3>
} finally {
    hz.shutdown();
}
----
+
<1> Create an instance of your pipeline.
<2> Create a bootstrapped Hazelcast member. This bootstrapped member allows you to submit your packaged classes to the cluster using the`hazelcast submit` command.
<3> Pass your pipeline to the bootstrapped Jet engine.

== Step 2. Submit your Job to the Cluster

After creating a pipeline, you can deploy it to your cluster by packaging the code into a JAR file and submitting it to the cluster.

After you submit the JAR file to the cluster, it will optimize the execution plan and start running the job for you.

. Package your Java code into a JAR file.
+
[TIP]
====
If you're using Maven, you can use the `mvn package` command to generate a JAR file.

If you're using Gradle, you can use the `gradle build` command to generate a JAR file.
====

. From the Hazelcast home directory execute the `hazelcast submit` command.
+
[tabs]
====
Binary::
+
--
Replace the following placeholders:

- $NAME_OF_MAIN_CLASS: The name of the main class in your packaged JAR file.
+
NOTE: To avoid the need to specify your main class in the `hazelcast submit` command, you should also set the `Main-Class` attribute in the `MANIFEST.MF`. Both Maven and Gradle can be configured to do this, refer to their docs.
- $PATH_TO_JAR_FILE: The path to your packaged JAR file.
- $MEMBER_IP: The IP address of a member in your cluster to which to submit the job.

[source,shell]
----
bin/hz-cli submit -c $NAME_OF_MAIN_CLASS $PATH_TO_JAR_FILE -t $MEMBER_IP
----
--
Docker::
+
--
Replace the following placeholders:

- $PATH_TO_JAR_FILE: The path to your packaged JAR file.
- $MEMBER_IP: The IP address of a member in your cluster to which to submit the job.
- $NAME_OF_MAIN_CLASS: The name of the main class in your packaged JAR file.
+
NOTE: To avoid the need to specify your main class in the `hazelcast submit` command, you should also set the `Main-Class` attribute in the `MANIFEST.MF`. Both Maven and Gradle can be configured to do this, refer to their docs.
- $NAME_OF_JAR_FILE: The name of your packaged JAR file.

[source,shell]
----
docker run -it -v $PATH_TO_JAR_FILE:/jars --rm hazelcast/Hazelcast -t $MEMBER_IP submit -c $NAME_OF_MAIN_CLASS /jars/$NAME_OF_JAR_FILE
----

Take a moment to learn which Docker parameters are included in this command:

- `-it`: Starts an interactive session, allowing you to cancel the `submit` command with *Ctrl+C*.
- `-v`: Mounts the directory that contains your JAR file from your current directory to the `/jars` directory inside your Docker container.
- `--rm`: Tells Docker to remove the container from its local cache after it exits.
--
====
+
In the console of your Hazelcast member, you should see that a new job has been submitted and it's running on your cluster.

. To see a list of running jobs on your cluster, execute the `list-jobs` command:
+
[tabs]
====
Binary::
+
--
```bash
bin/hz-cli list-jobs
```
--
Docker::
+
--
```bash
docker run -it hazelcast/Hazelcast -t 172.17.0.2 list-jobs
```
--
====
+
You should see the following:
+
```
ID                  STATUS             SUBMISSION TIME         NAME
03de-e38d-3480-0001 RUNNING            2020-02-09T16:30:26.843 N/A
```
+
Each job has a unique cluster-wide ID. You can use this ID to manage the job.
+
NOTE: A job with a streaming source will run indefinitely until explicitly canceled or the cluster is shut down. Even if you kill the client application, the job keeps running on the cluster.

== Step 3. Monitor your Jobs in Management Center

With Management Center, you can monitor the status of your jobs and manage the lifecycle of existing jobs in your cluster.

. In the left navigation panel of Management Center, go to *Streaming* > *Jobs*.
+
You should see that your job is running.
+
image:mc-job-status.png[A job that is running on the cluster]

. Click the job ID to open a detailed view of your job.
+
You should see a graph (DAG) in the center of the page. This graph is a visual representation of how Hazelcast optimizes your jobs for distributed execution. You can learn more about this concept in xref:architecture:distributed-computing.adoc[].
+
TIP: You can click any node on the graph to see more information about how your cluster is executing it.
+
image:mc-dag.gif[Clicking a node on the graph opens a modal window that displays its data processing details]

. To cancel your job, click *Cancel*.
+
image:mc-cancel-job.png[Cancel button at the top of the Jobs page]
+
In the console of the Hazelcast member, you should see that the job is canceled as well as the time it was started and how long it ran for.
+
```
Execution of job '062d-d578-9240-0001', execution 062d-d578-df80-0001 got terminated, reason=java.util.concurrent.CancellationException
	Start time: 2021-05-13T16:31:14.410
	Duration: 00:02:48.318
```
