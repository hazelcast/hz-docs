= LDAP Authentication
:page-enterprise: true

NOTE: A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server is a specialized server that stores and manages directory information in a hierarchical structure. It's commonly used for centralized authentication and authorization, storing information like user credentials, groups, and permissions. Applications and systems query the LDAP server to retrieve or modify this information, often to authenticate users or manage access rights. It's widely used in environments like enterprise networks for user management and directory services.

Hazelcast supports authentication and authorization against LDAP servers.
Authentication verifies the provided name and password, and authorization maps roles to the authenticated user.

You can verify passwords during authentication by:

* making a new LDAP bind operation with the given name and password
* using a separate "admin connection" to verify the provided password
against an LDAP object attribute.

There are several ways to retrieve role mappings:

* `attribute`: The role name is stored as an attribute in the object representing the identity.
* `direct` mapping: The identity object contains an attribute with reference to the role object(s).
* `reverse` mapping: The role objects with a reference to the identity object are searched.

The `direct` and `reverse` mapping modes allow a role search recursion.

.LDAP Configuration Options
|===
| Option Name
| Default Value
| Description

| `url`
|
| URL of the LDAP server. The value is configured as the JNDI environment
property, i.e. `java.naming.provider.url`.

| `socket-factory-class-name`
|
| Socket factory class name. The factory can be used for fine-grained
configuration of the TLS protocol on top of the LDAP protocol, i.e. `ldaps` scheme.

| `parse-dn`
| false
| If set to `true`, it treats the value of `role-mapping-attribute` as a DN and
extracts only the `role-name-attribute` values as role names. If set to `false`,
the whole value of `role-mapping-attribute` is used as a role name.

This option is only used when the `role-mapping-mode` option has the value `attribute`.

| `role-context`
|
| LDAP Context in which assigned roles are searched, e.g. `ou=Roles,dc=hazelcast,dc=com`.

This option is only used when the `role-mapping-mode` option has the value `reverse`.

| `role-filter`
| `([role-mapping-attribute]=\{memberDN})`
| LDAP search string which usually contains a placeholder `\{memberDN}` to be
replaced by the provided login name, e.g. `(member=\{memberDN})`.

If the role search recursion is enabled (see `role-recursion-max-depth`), the `\{memberDN}`
is replaced by role DNs in the recurrent searches.

This option is only used when the `role-mapping-mode` option has the value `reverse`.

| `role-mapping-attribute`
|
| Name of the LDAP attribute which contains either the role name or role DN.

This option is used when the `role-mapping-mode` option has the value `attribute` or `direct`.
If the mapping mode is `reverse`, the value is used in `role-filter` default value.

| `role-mapping-mode`
| `attribute`
a| Role mapping mode. It can have one of the following values:

* `attribute`: The user object in the LDAP contains the role name in the
given attribute. The role name can be parsed from a DN string when `parse-dn=true`
No additional LDAP query is done to find assigned roles.
* `direct`: The user object contains an attribute with DN(s) of assigned
role(s). Role objects are loaded from the LDAP and the role name is
retrieved from its attributes. Role search recursion can be enabled for this mode.
* `reverse`: The role objects are located by executing an LDAP search query
with the given `role-filter`. In this case, the role object usually contains
attributes with DNs of the assigned users. Role search recursion can be enabled for this mode.

| `role-name-attribute`
|
| This option may refer to a name of LDAP attribute within the role object which
contains the role name in case of `direct` and `reverse` role mapping mode. It may also refer
to the attribute name within X.500 name stored in `role-mapping-attribute` when
`role-mapping-mode=attribute` and `parse-dn=true`.

| `role-recursion-max-depth`
| 1
| Sets the maximum depth of role search recursion. The default value 1 means
the role search recursion is disabled.

This option is only used when the `role-mapping-mode` option has a `direct` or `reverse` value.

| `role-search-scope`
| `subtree`
a| LDAP search scope used for `role-filter` search. It can have one of the following values:

* `subtree`: Searches for objects in the given context and its subtree.
* `one-level`: Searches just one level under the given context.
* `object`: Searches (or tests) only for the context object itself (if it matches the filter criteria).

This option is only used when the `role-mapping-mode` option has the value `reverse`.

| `user-name-attribute`
| `uid`
| LDAP attribute name whose value is used as a name in
`ClusterIdentityPrincipal` added to the JAAS Subject.

| `system-user-dn`
|
a| Admin account DN. If configured, then the following are true:

* For the user and role object, search queries are used an admin connection instead
of the "user" one created by LDAP bind with provided credentials.
* LDAP authentication doesn't expect the full user DN to be provided as a login name.
It rather expects names like `"jduke"` than `"uid=jduke,ou=Engineering,o=Hazelcast,dc=com"`;
* The admin connection allows verifying the provided user credentials against a
value defined in the `password-attribute` option.

| `system-user-password`
|
| Admin's password (for `system-user-dn` account).


| `system-authentication`
| `simple`
| Name of the authentication mechanism used for the admin LDAP connection.
It's used as a value for the JNDI environment property `Context#SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION`.
You can specify `GSSAPI` to authenticate with the Kerberos protocol.

| `password-attribute`
|
| Credentials verification is done by the new LDAP binds by default.
However, the password can be stored in a non-default LDAP attribute; in this case use `password-attribute` to configure which
LDAP attribute (within the user object) contains the password. If the `password-attribute` option is provided,
then the extra LDAP bind to verify credentials is not done and passwords
are just compared within the Hazelcast code after retrieving the user object from LDAP server.

This option is only used when the admin connection is configured, i.e. when `system-user-dn` or `system-authentication` is defined.

| `user-context`
|
| LDAP context in which the user objects are searched, e.g., `ou=Users,dc=hazelcast,dc=com`.

This option is only used when the admin connection is configured, i.e. when `system-user-dn` or `system-authentication` is defined.

| `user-filter`
| `(uid=\{login})`
| LDAP search string for retrieving the user objects based on the provided login name.
It usually contains a placeholder substring `\{login}` which is replaced by the provided login name.

This option is only used when the admin connection is configured, i.e. when `system-user-dn` or `system-authentication` is defined.

| `user-search-scope`
| `subtree`
a| LDAP search scope used for `user-filter` search. It can have one of the following values:

* `subtree`: Searches for objects in the given context and its subtree.
* `one-level`: Searches just one-level under the given context.
* `object`: Searches (or tests) just for the context object itself (if it matches the filter criteria).

This option is only used when the admin connection is configured, i.e. when `system-user-dn` or `system-authentication` is defined.

| `skip-authentication`
| `false`
a| Flag which disables password verification and instead adds `HazelcastPrincipal` instances to the
Subject.

This option is only used when the admin connection is configured, i.e. when `system-user-dn` or `system-authentication` is defined.

| `security-realm`
|
a| If specified, the given realm name is used for authentication of
a (temporary) Subject which is then used for doing LDAP queries.

This option is only used when the admin connection is configured, i.e. when `system-user-dn` or `system-authentication` is defined.

Detailed logging for LDAP authentication can be enabled by
configuring a more verbose logger level for the `com.hazelcast.security`
package as described in the xref:security-debugging.adoc[Security Debugging section].

NOTE: The LDAP authentication implementation provided by Hazelcast doesn't handle LDAP referrals, i.e. references to other LDAP trees.

== TLS protected LDAP server connections

The LDAP authentication type supports TLS protected connections
to LDAP servers, using the `ldaps` protocol scheme. TLS is
handled on the Java runtime side (JNDI API and URL handlers).

When using TLS, by default the LDAP provider uses the socket factory `javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory` to create a TLS socket to communicate
with the server, using the default JSSE configuration. By default, the server's
certificate is validated against Java default CA certificate store, and the hostname
in the LDAP URL is verified against the name(s) in the server certificate. This behavior
can be controlled globally by using `javax.net.ssl.*` properties, as the following example shows:

[source,shell]
----
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/opt/hazelcast.truststore \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=123456 \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/opt/hazelcast.keystore \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=123456 \
  ...
----

There can be also properties specific to vendor or Java version that enable more
fine-grained control. Here is an example that disabls host name validation:

[source,shell]
----
-Dcom.sun.jndi.ldap.object.disableEndpointIdentification=true
----

When even more control is necessary, you can implement your own
`SSLSocketFactory` and use its class name as the value in the `ldap`
authentication option `socket-factory-class-name`.

Here is an example custom socket factory class:

[source,java]

LDAP authentication is backed by the JNDI API in Java and also has failover support. You can configure multiple space-separated
URLs in the `<url>` option:
