= Vector Collection Connector
:description: Vector collection stores vectors with their related metadata. This allows entries to be found efficiently based on vector distance.

For further information on vector collections, see xref:data-structures:vector-collections.adoc[].

== Installing the Connector

This connector is included in the full and slim {enterprise-product-name} distributions of Hazelcast.

== Permissions
If xref:security:enable-security.adoc[security] is enabled, you can set up permissions to restrict clients' access to these data structures.

To search in vector collection, you must add the `create` and `read` permissions for those collections. If you use the vector collection sink to write to vector collections, you must add the `create` and `put` permissions for those collections.

For further information on adding these permissions, see xref:security:client-authorization.adoc[].


== Vector Collection as a Sink

To write an entry to a vector collection, to index it for searching, create a key and `VectorDocument`, which consists of
additional metadata and vectors (embeddings). Embeddings can be generated earlier in the pipeline or loaded or obtained from external source.


```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(Sources.<String, String>map("idToDocumentText"))
  // generate embeddings
  .mapUsingService(getAllMiniLmL6V2EmbeddingModelServiceFactory(),
            (service, e) -> tuple3(e.getKey(), e.getValue(), VectorValues.of(service.embed(e.getValue()).content().vector())))
  // write to vector collection
  .writeTo(VectorSinks.vectorCollection("indexedDocuments", Tuple3::f0, Tuple3::f1, Tuple3::f2));
```


== Searching in Vector Collection

You can search vector collections in Jet pipelines using `VectorTransforms.mapUsingVectorSearch` transformation.

```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(TestSources.items("text to search for"))
  // generate embedding for the object for which we are finding similarities
  .mapUsingService(getAllMiniLmL6V2EmbeddingModelServiceFactory(),
            (service, query) -> tuple2(query, VectorValues.of(service.embed(query).content().vector())))
  // find similar objects
  .apply(VectorTransforms.mapUsingVectorSearch("indexedDocuments",
            SearchOptions.builder().limit(10).includeValue().build(),
            // query vector
            Tuple3::f1,
            // process the search results
            (input, result) -> tuple2(input, result)))
  // use the results
  .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
```

== Embedding Models

The examples above use `all-minilm-l6-v2` model via langchain4j binding for ONNX but any embedding model can be invoked from Jet pipeline in similar way.

The embedding model requires adding a dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>langchain4j-embeddings-all-minilm-l6-v2</artifactId>
    <version>0.30.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The dependency must be provided on member classpath or in case of smaller models it can be uploaded in job resources.

The embedding model is defined as a non-cooperative Jet service because the embedding computation can take some time.

```java
ServiceFactory<?, AllMiniLmL6V2EmbeddingModel> getAllMiniLmL6V2EmbeddingModelServiceFactory() {
    return ServiceFactories.sharedService(c -> new AllMiniLmL6V2EmbeddingModel()).toNonCooperative();
}
```
