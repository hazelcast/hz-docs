= Start a Local Cluster with the CLI
:description: Follow this five-minute tutorial to set up a Hazelcast cluster for testing or evaluation purposes. In five minutes, you will learn how to install Hazelcast with a package manager, start a local cluster with the CLI, write data to memory and visualize that data.

== Step 1. Install Hazelcast

include::install-hazelcast.adoc[tag=cli]

== Step 2. Start a Local Cluster

Hazelcast clusters consist of servers that we call members. These members communicate with each other to form a distributed network. It's these members that store and process your data.

. To start a standalone Hazelcast member, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
hz start
----
+
You should see the following in the console:
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
INFO: [192.168.1.164]:5701 [dev] [{full-version}] <1>

Members {size:1, ver:1} [ <2>
	Member [192.168.1.164]:5701 - 4221d540-e34e-4ff2-8ad3-41e060b895ce this
]
----
+
<1> The local IP address of your Hazelcast member followed by the default cluster name (dev) and the version of Hazelcast that you are running.
<2> The size of your cluster. Here, you just have one member, so the size is 1.

. To add one more member to the cluster, open another terminal window and run the `start` command again.
+
[source,shell]
----
hz start
----
+
The members
discover each other automatically and form a two-member cluster. You should see
the following in the console:
+
[source,shell]
----
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 - e40081de-056a-4ae5-8ffe-632caf8a6cf1 this
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 - 93e82109-16bf-4b16-9c87-f4a6d0873080
]
----

NOTE: These members use the default configuration, which is defined in the `hazelcast.xml` file. The location of this file is printed on the first line of
the output of the `start` command.

== Step 3. Connect the Management Center

Management Center is a user interface for managing and monitoring your cluster.

In this step, you install and start a local instance of Management Center and connect it to your cluster.

include::{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:getting-started:install.adoc[tag=cli]

. Start Management Center.
+
[source,shell]
----
hz-mc start
----

. In a web browser, go to localhost:8080 to open Management Center.

. On the landing page of Management Center, enable dev mode.
+

. Create a connection, using the default settings.
+
You should see that you cluster is in an active state and has a single member. An active cluster is stable and operating without restrictions.

== Step 4. Write Data to Memory

Hazelcast has lots of distributed data structures available for writing data to memory on your cluster. One of the most popular ways of writing data to memory is to use a distributed map. Maps store key/value pairs called entries, which are replicated and distributed across a cluster.

The quickest way to write some data to a map is to use the CLI console.

. To start the console, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
hz-cli console
----

. Enter the following to create a map and write some data to it:
+
- `ns my-distributed-map`
- `m.put "1" "John"`
- `m.put "2" "Mary"`
- `m.put "3" "Jane"`
+
You'll see that each of the `m.put` lines returns `null`, which means that the data was written to the map.

. In Management Center, go to *Storage* > *Maps*.
+
You should see that your cluster has a map called `my-distributed-map` with three entries (keys and values). You'll also see the total amount of memory that those entries are taking up in your cluster.
