CAUTION: {ucn} can replace resources dynamically, but that does not affect the lifecycle of existing instances using older class versions.
This means that the creation of new objects will use new resources (latest bytecode), but older objects won't be removed and recreated automatically; in this case a manual intervention is needed, such as destroying and recreating relevant objects, or restarting Hazelcast members.
This is particularly applicable to long-living objects tied to the lifecycle of Hazelcast data structures, such as `IMap`'s `MapLoader`s: deploying a new version won't replace an existing `MapLoader`, and to refresh such an object, a cluster restart would be required.
