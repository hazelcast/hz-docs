== Examples

This section lists some example SQL queries that show you how to use the `ALTER JOB` statement.

[[suspend]]
=== Suspend and Resume a Job

You may want to suspend a job to perform maintenance on a source or a sink without disrupting the job.

[source,sql]
----
ALTER JOB track_trades SUSPEND
----

When maintenance is finished, you can resume the job to restart it.

[source,sql]
----
ALTER JOB track_trades RESUME
----
[[restart]]
=== Restart a Job

You may want to restart a job if you want to distribute it over some new members in your cluster and auto-scaling is disabled.

[source,sql]
----
ALTER JOB track_trades RESTART
----
[[update]]
=== Update the Configuration of a Suspended Job

For troubleshooting, you may want to update the configuration of a failed job to see if processing fewer items allows the job to run successfully.

[source,sql]
----
ALTER JOB track_trades OPTIONS ('maxProcessorAccumulatedRecords'='100') RESUME
----

NOTE: By default, all streaming jobs are automatically suspended on failure.
