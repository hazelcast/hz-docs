= Configure Feature Store
:description: To use a Feast project, you must configure the feature store. The configuration is defined in a YAML configuration file.

{description}

The feature store forms part of the feature repository. The feature repository stores the configuration to run Feast on your infrastructure and the feature definitions in a central location. It provides the declarative source of truth for the desired state of the feature store. The feature repository consists of the following:

* Feature declarations in Python files 
* Infrastructural configuration in the _feature_store.yaml_ file
* Paths to ignore in the feature repository in the _.feastignore_ file

By default, the feature repository is the current directory. This can be changed using the Feast CLI, as described in the link:https://docs.feast.dev/reference/feast-cli-commands[Feast CLI reference, window=_blank] documentation.

For further information on the feature repository, refer to the link:https://docs.feast.dev/reference/feature-repository[Feature repository, window=_blank] topic of the Feast documentation.

The _feature_store.yaml_ file defines the following:

* The environment in which Feast deploys and operates. This is defined in the `project` section
* The location of the feature registry. This is defined in the `registry` section
* The online store. This is defined in the `online_store` section
* The offline store. This is defined in the `offline_store` section
* The namespace to use for the feature store. This can be used to isolate multiple deployments in a single Feast installation, and can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. This is defined in the `project` section
* The materialization engine. This is defined in the `engine` section
* The serialization service. This serializes the entity key to a bytestring to allow it to be be used as a lookup key in a hash table. You can specify Feast's serialization service. This is defined in the `entity_key_serialization_version` section

== Configure Hazelcast as Online Store

The `online-store` section configures the online store and initializes a config object, which is passed to the `OnlineStore` interface by Feast to create the connection.

The available options are as follows:

[cols="1,1,1,1"]

|Name |Type |Description |Default Value

|cluster_name

|["localhost:5701"]

|discovery_token
|String
|Discovery token used by a Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} cluster
|""

|ssl_cafile_path
|String
|Absolute path of CA certificates in PEM format

|ssl_certfile_path
|String
|Absolute path of the client certificate in PEM format
|""

|ssl_keyfile_path
|String
|Absolute path of theprivate key file for the client certificate in PEM format
|""

|ssl_password
|String
|Password for decrypting the keyfile, if encrypted
|""

|key_ttl_seconds
|Integer
|Hazelcast key bin TTL for expiring entities, in seconds
|0

=== Example Local Cluster Configuration

You can configure the connection to a local cluster as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
online_store:
    type: hazelcast
    cluster_name: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
    cluster_members: [<YOUR_CLUSTER_MEMBERS>]
    ssl_cafile_path: <PATH_TO_CA_CERT>
    ssl_certfile_path: <PATH_TO_CLIENT_CERT>
    ssl_keyfile_path: <PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE>
    ssl_password: <PATH_TO_DECRYPTION_PSWD>
    key_ttl_seconds: <TTL_IN_SECONDS>
----

=== Example SSL-enabled Cluster Configuration

You can configure an SSL-enabled connection as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
online_store:
    type: hazelcast
    cluster_name: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
    cluster_members: [<YOUR_CLUSTER_MEMBERS>]
    sl_cafile_path: <PATH_TO_CA_CERT>
    ssl_certfile_path: <PATH_TO_CLIENT_CERT>
    kssl_keyfile_path: <PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE>
    ssl_password: <YOUR_SSL_PASSWORD>
