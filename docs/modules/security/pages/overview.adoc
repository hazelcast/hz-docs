This section provides an introduction to the security features of Hazelcast.
These features allow you to perform security activities, such as encrypting network communication using TLS,
controlling access permissions of clients, or logging auditable events.
The security features explained in this chapter are the features of
[blue]#Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}# edition.

While Hazelcast supports non-secured cluster members and clients,
it is recommended to secure your deployments. A cluster without security may face with:

* unauthorized cluster members joining or accessing it
* unwanted or malicious clients accessing it
* unauthorized use (access or creation) of cluster resources and data tampering by the malicious cluster members and clients.

Below, you can see the brief descriptions of Hazelcast's security features.
You can evaluate them and decide which ones you want to use based on your
security concerns and requirements. 

For data privacy:

* xref:security:tls-ssl.adoc[TLS] communication for members and clients for all socket-level communication;
uses  key stores and trust stores to encrypt communications across a Hazelcast cluster,
as well as between the clusters replicated over WAN.

For authentication:

* xref:security:authentication-overview.adoc[authentication] between the cluster members, and for clients accessing the cluster.
Security Realms are used for authentication and identity configurations;
* xref:security:tls-ssl.adoc#mutual-authentication[TLS Mutual Authentication] to ensure each TLS-communicating
side proves its identity to the other.

For authorization:

* xref:security:client-authorization.adoc#authorization[authorization]Â using
permission policies for role-based security.

Hazelcast has a pluggable security component architecture allowing use your own code to control security:

* pluggable xref:security:jaas-authentication.adoc[authentication] and xref:security:identity-configuration#credentials-factory[identity];
* xref:security:socket-interceptor.adoc[Socket Interceptor] to interfere socket connections
before a new member or client comes to the cluster; you can perform identity checking using custom
authentication protocols.
* xref:security:security-interceptor.adoc[Security Interceptor] that provides a callback
point for client operations executed against the cluster.

See also xref:secure-cluster:security-best-practices.adoc[Security best practices] and xref:secure-cluster:hardening-recommendations.adoc[Security Hardening Recommendations] to learn more about security best practices.

Security-related areas that are covered in other sections of the documentation include:

* Network and Advanced Network configuration allow specifying bind interfaces;
* Advanced Network configuration allows separating socket addresses for different protocols;
* Management operations can be limited to specific IP addresses where Management Center is allowed to run;
* Untrusted deserialization protection allows control of which types are allowed in Java native deserialization;

Hazelcast distributions contain security-hardened example configuration files that help users to review configuration sections related to deployment security.

== Hazelcast Jet considerations

When using Hazelcast's Jet streaming engine, notice the following security considerations:

* Hazelcast jobs allow you to use your custom code and this code must be available on
cluster classpath or deployed to the cluster; this means any client is able to deploy
custom code to the cluster, so make sure each client is authorized to access the cluster.
* The Jet engine bypasses the access control layer when accessing the data structures in the same cluster.
* The connectors of the Jet engine include third-party code which may increase the attack surface.
* SQL, which is used by the Jet engine, includes file connectors and it can read files on the cluster filesystem.

Due to the above considerations, access to Hazelcast's streaming engine is disabled by default for our users who
mostly use Hazelcast's storage engine (formerly known as Hazelcast IMDG) with the JAR distribution
(See the xref:secure-cluster:security-defaults.adoc[Security Defaults section] for information about
the security considerations for different Hazelcast distributions).
xref:configuration:jet-configuration.adoc[Enabling the Jet Engine section] shows how you can
start using the Jet engine; relatedly, see the xref:secure-cluster:hardening-recommendations.adoc[Security Hardening Recommendations section]
to learn the best practices to secure your cluster.
