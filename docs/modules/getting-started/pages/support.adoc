= Get support
:description: Hazelcast provides two types of support: one for {open-source-product-name} users and one for {enterprise-product-name} customers.

{description}

== Community support

Community support is available to every Hazelcast user. You can use the following channels to get community support:

* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast[Hazelcast GitHub] (for reporting issues through our GitHub repository)
* https://slack.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast Community Slack^].

== Customer support

Customer support is available to {enterprise-product-name} customers.
See https://hazelcast.com/services/support/?utm_source=docs-website[hazelcast.com^] for the support options.

A support subscription from Hazelcast provides rapid response times to technical
support inquiries, access to critical software patches, and other services which
will help you achieve increased productivity and quality. Learn more about Hazelcast support subscriptions:
https://hazelcast.com/pricing/?utm_source=docs-website[https://hazelcast.com/pricing/]

=== Access the support portal

If your organization subscribes to Hazelcast support,
and you already have an account setup, you can login to your account and open
a support request using our ticketing system: https://support.hazelcast.com/s/?utm_source=docs-website[Hazelcast Support Portal].

=== Submit a Hazelcast support ticket

To help Hazelcast Support diagnose and resolve issues quickly, provide as much accurate and complete information as possible. This section explains how to prepare your environment, what information to collect, which logs to include, and how to submit a ticket.

==== Before submitting a ticket

First, enable the following in all environments before an issue occurs:

*Hazelcast diagnostics logging*

Diagnostics logs capture cluster state, performance metrics, slow operations, system events, WAN replication details, and JVM/OS properties. These logs are disabled by default but should be enabled in almost all cases. Do not truncate diagnostics logs. For configuration instructions, see the xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#logging[Diagnostics and Logging].

*Hazelcast logs*

Ensure each Hazelcast member logs:

- HealthMonitor output
- Client connection and disconnection events
- Slow operation details
- Stack traces
- Cluster health and performance information

Configure retention and rotation so logs cover multiple cycles.

Hazelcast defaults to JDK logging; configure log4j, log4j2, or logback (via slf4j) for production systems.

*JVM garbage collection logs*

Enable GC logging in production environments for performance analysis.

Java 8 and below:
----
-verbose:gc
-Xloggc:gc.log
-XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=10
-XX:GCLogFileSize=10M
-XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation
-XX:+PrintGCDetails
-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps
-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime
----

Java 9 and above:
----
-Xlog:safepoint,gc+age=debug,gc*=debug:file=gc.log:uptime,level,tags:filesize=10m,filecount=10
----

Next, collect observations and evidence

Prepare the following information before submitting a ticket:
- Clear description of the issue. Summarize the problem and include relevant context.
- Steps to reproduce. Include detailed steps. If the issue cannot be reproduced, document the sequence of events leading up to the incident.
- Error messages and screenshots. Include stack traces, exceptions, UI errors, or any visual evidence.
- Detailed timeline. Record what happened and when, including the exact incident date and time.

*Hazelcast configuration to include:*

*Hazelcast member configuration*
Provide one of the following:
- The XML or YAML configuration file, or
- The programmatic configuration (Java Config object)

You can also export configuration from each member through Management Center > Members.

*Hazelcast client configuration*

Include configuration for each connected client:

|Node.js

|Python

|C++

*Log and Diagnostic Data to Include*

Attach complete logs and diagnostic files. Missing or truncated logs delay troubleshooting.

Required logs:

- Hazelcast member logs
- Hazelcast diagnostics logs (do not truncate)
- Hazelcast process logs
- Hazelcast Health Monitor logs
- JVM GC logs
- Thread dumps from all members
- Heap dumps (if relevant)
- Networking logs (firewall, proxy, load balancer, packet captures)
- OS, cluster manager, or JVM logs relevant to the issue

If you must truncate a log, ensure the startup section—containing environment and system details—is included.

Ensure all logs include entries for the incident time window. Consistent timestamps across systems greatly improves analysis accuracy.

==== Complete the support ticket

Submit the ticket through the Hazelcast Support Portal and include the following sections:

1. Title and description
+
Write a clear, concise title summarising the problem. In the description, provide:
+
•	What you observed
•	What you expected
•	When the issue occurred
•	Whether the issue is ongoing, intermittent, or resolved
+
2. Steps to reproduce
+
Document detailed steps so Support can attempt to reproduce the issue.
+
3. Optional reproducible test case
+
If available, include a minimal project or code sample that demonstrates the problem. Engineering may request this later if required.
+
4. Use case details
+
Explain how you use Hazelcast, including:
+
•	Data structures involved
•	Client types
•	Cluster size
•	Deployment environment (cloud, on-prem, containerised)
•	Any recent changes (upgrades, configuration changes, scaling events)
+
This information helps Support identify which components may be affected.

==== Set the ticket severity

Choose the correct severity to ensure the issue is routed appropriately.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Severity |Description

|Level 1
|Current production outage with no workaround

|Level 2
|Current production outage with a temporary workaround (for example, serving static content)

|Level 3
|Development issues, low-impact production issues, or analysis of an incident that has already ended

|Level 4
|General questions, enhancement requests, or other non-critical issues
|===

After submitting your ticket, respond promptly to any follow-up questions or requests for additional data as timely communication helps accelerate investigation and resolution.

==== Summary

To ensure the fastest possible resolution:

•	Collect detailed observations before submitting a ticket
•	Provide complete, untruncated logs and diagnostics
•	Include Hazelcast and client configuration files
•	Select the correct severity level
•	Keep diagnostics and logging enabled in all environments
•	Communicate promptly with Hazelcast Support
