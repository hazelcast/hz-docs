= Use Data Connection service
:description: Using the Data Connection Service gives access to the configured xref:data-connections-configuration.adoc[data connections] in custom components.

{description}

== Typical usage

The typical steps to use a data connection are as follows:

1. Obtain the data connection from the data connection service.
2. Retrieve the underlying resource from the `DataConnection` instance. This step varies based on the specific implementation of `DataConnection` (e.g. `JdbcDataConnection` provides `getConnection()` which returns a `java.sql.Connection`; `HazelcastDataConnection` provides `getClient()` which returns a `HazelcastInstance`).
3. Use the resource to perform the required operations.
4. Dispose of the resource (e.g., by calling `Connection#close` or `HazelcastInstance#destroy`).
5. Release the `DataConnection` instance (by calling `DataConnection#release()`).

You should complete steps 2, 3, and 4 as quickly as possible to maximize the efficiency of connection pooling.

    // ... work with connection <3>

    // try-with-resources statement closes the connection <4>
} catch (SQLException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to load value for key=" + key, e);
}

== Retrieve Data Connection service

Before working with data connections you need to retrieve an instance of the `DataConnectionService`. Use
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/HazelcastInstance.html#getDataConnectionService()[`HazelcastInstance#getDataConnectionService()`]
to obtain an instance of `DataConnectionService`.

You can implement HazelcastInstanceAware in listeners, entry processors, tasks etc. to get access
to the `HazelcastInstance`.

In the pipeline API you can use
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/ProcessorMetaSupplier.Context.html#dataConnectionService()[ProcessorMetaSupplier.Context#dataConnectionService()].

NOTE: The Data Connection Service is only available on the member side. Calling `getDataConnectionService()` on a client results in `UnsupportedOperationException`.

== Retrieve configured DataConnection

Use the `DataConnectionService` to get an instance of previously configured data connection https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/dataconnection/DataConnectionService.html#getAndRetainDataConnection(java.lang.String,java.lang.Class)[DataConnectionService#getAndRetainDataConnection(String, Class)]. For details how to configure a data connection, please refer
to the xref:data-connections-configuration.adoc[Configuring Data Connections] page.

== Data Connection scope

The data connection configuration is per-member. For example, when a data connection is created
with maximum pool size of 10 and the cluster has 3 members, up to 30 connections will be
created.

== Data Connection sharing

Data connection is shared by default. This means that when the data connection is requested in multiple places, the same
underlying resource (e.g. JDBC pool, remote client) is used.
If you want to share the data connection configuration, but use a different instance of the underlying resource,
set the `DataConnectionConfig#setShared` to false.

== Configuration considerations

If the data connection is defined in the Hazelcast configuration, it remains immutable for the entire lifespan of the Hazelcast member. In this case, whether you retrieve the DataConnection instance once or each time before accessing the underlying resource, the result will be the same.

However, if the data connection is created dynamically via SQL, it can be replaced using `CREATE OR REPLACE DATA CONNECTION`. For more information, see xref:sql:get-started-sql.adoc[].
In such cases, the DataConnection instance will stay valid until you release it, allowing you to retrieve the underlying resource as needed. This approach can be useful for adapting to changes in data connection configuration.

For example, if you are running a batch job and want to use the same data connection throughout, request the connection at the start of the job. For a streaming job that may need updated configurations, retrieve both the data connection and the underlying resource just before use (e.g. when processing each item in the pipeline).
