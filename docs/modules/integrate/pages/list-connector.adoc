= List Connector

A list is a simple data structure which is ordered, and not
partitioned. All the contents of the `IList` will reside only on one
member.

== Installing the Connector

This connector is included in the full and slim distributions of Hazelcast.

== Permissions

If you use Hazelcast Enterprise, you can set up permissions to restrict clients' access to these data structures. For details, see xref:security:native-client-security.adoc[].

== List as a Source or Sink

The API for it is very limited, but is useful for simple prototyping:

```java
IList<Integer> inputList = hz.getList("inputList");
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    inputList.add(i);
}

Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(Sources.list(inputList))
 .map(i -> "item-" + i)
 .writeTo(Sinks.list("resultList"));
```

NOTE: List isn't suitable to use as a streaming sink because items are always
appended and eventually the member will run out of memory.
