= Getting Started with a Hazelcast Client
:description: Hazelcast has clients in Java, .NET, Python, C++, Go, and Node.js. You can use these clients to communicate with cluster members.

{description}

For an overview of available clients, see xref:client-overview.adoc[].   
For documentation and code samples for each client, see the following:

* xref:java.adoc[Java]
* xref:dotnet.adoc[.NET]
* xref:python.adoc[Python]
* xref:cplusplus.adoc[C++]
* xref:go.adoc[Go]
* xref:nodejs.adoc[Node.js]

Alternatively, you can use xref:memcache.adoc[Memcache] to communicate directly with a Hazelcast cluster, or use the xref:rest.adoc[REST] API for simple operations. 

Additional tools are available to help operate and manage Hazelcast Platform clusters:
