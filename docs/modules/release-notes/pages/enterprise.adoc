=== Security
* *Resolved gRPC security vulnerabilities and updated Python support for Jet transforms:* Fixed multiple vulnerabilities (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11407[CVE-2024-11407] and https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53864[CVE-2025-53864]) by upgrading the gRPC dependency, which required dropping support for Python 3.7 in Python-based transforms. Those transforms in Data Pipelines now require at least Python 3.8.0. This is a *breaking change only for users still on Python 3.7*, which is already end-of-life.
* *Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13009[CVE-2024-13009], https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45801[CVE-2024-45801], https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-47875[CVE-CVE-2024-47875], and https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26791[CVE-2025-26791] in Jetty:* Fixed multiple vulnerabilities by upgrading the Jetty dependency.
* *Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-47561[CVE-2024-47561] in Apache Avro:* Fixed a vulnerability by upgrading the Apache Avro dependency.
* *Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-25638[CVE-2024-25638], https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-29131[CVE-2024-29131], and https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48734[CVE-2025-48734] in Apache Hadoop:* Fixed multiple vulnerabilities by upgrading the Apache Hadoop dependency.
* *Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-7254[CVE-2024-7254] in Protobuf:* Fixed an information disclosure vulnerability by upgrading the Protobuf dependency.
* *Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-52520[CVE-2025-52520], https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53506[CVE-2025-53506], and https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-41249[CVE-2025-41249] in Spring Boot:* Fixed multiple vulnerabilities by upgrading the Spring Boot dependency.
* *Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55163[CVE-2025-55163] in Netty:* Fixed HTTP/2 control frame handling vulnerability by upgrading the Netty dependency.
* *Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48989[CVE-2025-48989] in Apache Tomcat Embed:* Fixed an issue about improper resource shutdown by upgrading the Apache Tomcat embed dependency. 

=== Fixes
* *Fixed delayed cleanup of job resources in Jet jobs:* Resolved an issue where job resource IMaps were not deleted swiftly on job completion and instead lingered until the 2-hour default expiration, increasing memory usage and cleanup overhead. The fix restores immediate deletion of job resources  and corrects cleanup when resource uploads partially fail for files and directories.
* *Fixed incorrect filtering of non-expired entries in global indexes:* Enhanced the thread-safe handling of expired entries in global indexes (originally addressed in 5.4.3), where a race condition allowed one thread to modify expiry metadata while another was reading it. This bug could cause non-expired entries to be incorrectly filtered out from query results. The fix ensures consistent expiry metadata access across threads so that only truly expired entries are excluded.


== 5.4.3

**Release date**: 2025-08-27

This is a maintenance release for {enterprise-product-name}. 

For help downloading Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}, see xref:getting-started:install-enterprise.adoc[] or https://hazelcast.com/trial-request/?utm_source=docs-website[request a trial license key].

=== Security
* *Security Fix for CVE-2024-13009 – Request body data leakage via Jetty GzipHandler in Jetty server library:* Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13009[CVE-2024-13009], a high-severity vulnerability in `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server` where `GzipHandler` may incorrectly release buffers on gzip inflate errors, potentially causing parts of a request body to be exposed to subsequent requests.
* *Security Fix for CVE-2025-24970 – Native crash via Netty SslHandler input validation:* Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24970[CVE-2025-24970], a high-severity vulnerability in `io.netty:netty-handler` where `SslHandler` may not correctly validate specially crafted packets when using the native `SSLEngine`, leading to a potential native process crash.
* *Security Fix for CVE-2025-27817 – Arbitrary file read and SSRF via Kafka OAUTHBEARER endpoints in kafka-clients:* Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27817[CVE-2025-27817], a moderate vulnerability in `org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients` where untrusted configuration of `sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url` or `sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url` could enable arbitrary file read via error logs and server-side request forgery.
* *Security Fix for CVE-2025-27818 – Deserialization of untrusted data via SASL JAAS login modules in Apache Kafka/Connect:* Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27818[CVE-2025-27818], a high-severity issue in `org.apache.kafka:kafka` where an authenticated operator could set `sasl.jaas.config` to `com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule`, triggering LDAP-based deserialization that may enable Remote Code Execution.
* *Security Fix for CVE-2025-46701 – Security constraint bypass via CGI servlet pathInfo case handling in Apache Tomcat:* Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46701[CVE-2025-46701], a low-severity issue where improper case-sensitivity handling in the CGI servlet could allow bypass of security constraints applied to the pathInfo component.
* *Security Fix for CVE-2025-48988 – Denial of service via multipart upload in Apache Tomcat:* Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detailCVE-2025-48988/[CVE-2025-48988], a high-severity issue where unrestricted resource allocation during multipart upload handling could enable a denial of service. 
* *Security Fix for CVE-2025-49124 – Untrusted search path in Apache Tomcat Windows installer:* Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49124[CVE-2025-49124], a high-severity issue where the Windows installer invoked `icacls.exe` without a fully qualified path, enabling potential DLL or binary hijacking during installation.
* *Security Fix for PRISMA-2023-0067 – Denial of service via uncontrolled resource consumption in Jackson:* Resolved https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/827[PRISMA-2023-0067], a high-severity issue where `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core` did not properly restrict resource usage, enabling potential DoS through uncontrolled resource consumption.

=== Fixes
* *Fixed handling of expired entries when depopulating global indexes:* Resolved an issue where expired entries were skipped during the cleanup of global indexes on migration source nodes. This caused query threads to encounter dangling pointers in the index, leading to JVM crashes. The fix ensures that expired entries are included when depopulating global indexes, preventing such crashes and improving system stability.
* *Fixed Kafka Connector Compatibility:* Resolved an issue where some connectors were incompatible with Kafka Connect Runtime > 3.9.0 due to missing `kafka-clients` utilities. This caused connector failures during runtime. The fix ensures that the `kafka-clients` dependency is included, restoring compatibility for affected connectors.

=== Packaging

*Repository configuration update:* We have updated the public GPG key and the RPM repository configuration file. 
To continue installing or upgrading Hazelcast via package managers, you must refresh your local setup.
Without this update, upgrading to the newer Hazelcast versions via package managers will fail.

*Debian/Ubuntu users:* 
If you already have the Hazelcast APT repository configured, you need to re-fetch and re-add the GPG key:

[source,bash]
----
wget -qO - https://repository.hazelcast.com/api/gpg/key/public | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hazelcast-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
----

*RHEL/CentOS/Fedora users:* 
You need to re-download and replace the repository file:

[source,bash]
----
wget https://repository.hazelcast.com/rpm/stable/hazelcast-rpm-stable.repo -O hazelcast-rpm-stable.repo
sudo mv hazelcast-rpm-stable.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
----


== 5.4.2

**Release date**: 2025-06-30

This is a maintenance release for {enterprise-product-name}. 

For help downloading Hazelcast {enterprise-product-name}, see xref:getting-started:install-enterprise.adoc[] or https://hazelcast.com/trial-request/?utm_source=docs-website[request a trial license key].

=== Enhancements

* *Added system property to bypass cluster name check during client authentication:* Introduced the system property `hazelcast.client.internal.skip.cluster.namecheck.during.connection` (default: false) to allow clients to connect without matching the cluster name. This helps ease upgrades in environments with large numbers of existing clients where updating configurations is impractical. When enabled, the cluster name validation is skipped during client authentication.
* *Added ZGC statistics support:* Added support for exposing garbage collector statistics when using Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) with Java 17+. Previously, `GcStats` metrics remained empty due to missing bean name registration, limiting observability in ZGC-enabled environments. This update ensures `minorGcTime`, `majorGcCount`, and related metrics are correctly populated, enabling effective GC monitoring and troubleshooting.
* *Improved latency distribution tracking for InvocationProfiler and OperationProfiler:* Enhanced the `InvocationProfiler` and `OperationProfiler` diagnostic plugins to record latency distributions with finer granularity by distinguishing operations wrapped in the `OperationFactoryWrapper` class. This improvement provides better visibility into cluster activity and helps diagnose performance issues more effectively.

=== Security

* *Security Fix for CVE-2025-30065 – Remote code execution via parquet-avro in hazelcast-sql module:* Resolved https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30065[CVE-2025-30065], a critical vulnerability in the `org.apache.parquet:parquet-avro:1.14.1` transitive dependency used by the hazelcast-sql module. The issue allows remote code execution via malicious Avro schema deserialization when reading Avro-encoded Parquet files.

=== Fixes
* *Fixed AWS discovery failure due to overly restrictive region regex:* Resolved an issue where Hazelcast failed to form clusters in valid AWS regions such as `us-iso-east-1` due to an overly restrictive regular expression in region detection.
* *Fixed NullPointerException during Continuous Query Cache event serialization under load:* Resolved an issue where Continuous Query Cache (CQC) events were frequently lost under high load due to internal `NullPointerException` during event serialization. The root cause was a missing null check in the event encoding logic, leading to failures in dispatching CQC updates and resulting in stale cache data. The fix adds proper `null` handling to ensure reliable event delivery even in large, high-throughput clusters.
* *Fixed handling of expired entries when depopulating global indexes:* Resolved an issue where expired entries were skipped during the cleanup of global indexes on migration source nodes. This caused query threads to encounter dangling pointers in the index, leading to JVM crashes. The fix ensures that expired entries are included when depopulating global indexes, preventing such crashes and improving system stability.
* *Fixed performance degradation for large input lengths in ByteArrayObjectDataOutput:* Resolved an issue where providing an input length greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2` caused significant performance degradation (up to 100x). This was due to the buffer resizing in small increments instead of a single large increment, as the doubling strategy would overflow and result in a negative value. The fix ensures that in cases of overflow, the buffer length is set to `MAX_ARRAY_SIZE`, which is approximately the largest supported array size in the JVM.
* *Fixed handling of DestroyQueryCacheOperation after cache configuration removal:* Resolved an issue where calling `DestroyQueryCacheOperation` after a cache configuration was removed resulted in a `NullPointerException`. The fix ensures that a `NullPointerException` is no longer thrown in this scenario. Instead, the operation now handles the exception gracefully and logs a finest-level entry, improving robustness and debuggability of cache operations.
* *Fixed exception when using CREATE MAPPING with SQL statement-timeout-millis configured:* Resolved an issue where setting a non-zero value for `statement-timeout-millis` in the SQL configuration caused exceptions for statements that do not support timeouts, such as `CREATE MAPPING`. Previously, executing such statements would result in a descriptive but unnecessary exception `(CREATE MAPPING does not support timeout)`, which could prevent client applications from starting if `CREATE MAPPING` was part of the initialization process. The fix ensures that non-timeout-supported statements like `CREATE MAPPING` succeed as expected, regardless of the `statement-timeout-millis` configuration.
* *Fixed data loss on rapid graceful shutdown after data insertion:* Resolved an issue where performing a graceful shutdown immediately after inserting data could result in lost entries and missing SQL mappings upon cluster restart. The fix ensures all data is fully persisted before shutdown completes, preventing data loss in fast shutdown scenarios.
* *Fixed issue with hot backup failing after changing the backup folder during a rolling restart:* Resolved an issue where hot backups would fail if the underlying backup folder was changed during a rolling restart and a hot backup was subsequently initiated from the Management Center (MC). This fix ensures that hot backups function correctly even after the backup folder is updated during a rolling restart.
* *Fixed TTL eviction issue for entries loaded from MapLoader:* Resolved an issue where entries loaded from a `MapLoader` into an `IMap` with `time-to-live (TTL)`-based eviction enabled were not evicted after the configured TTL. This caused entries to persist indefinitely, contrary to the expected behavior where such entries should expire after the TTL. The fix restores the correct behavior, ensuring that entries loaded from a `MapLoader` respect the configured TTL and are evicted as expected.
* *Fixed stuck hot backup state after NativeOutOfMemoryError during backup:* Resolved an issue where a `NativeOutOfMemoryError` during hot backup caused the backup status to remain stuck in progress, preventing subsequent backups from completing. This occurred due to unhandled `ConcurrentConveyorException` during event queue draining. The fix ensures such failures are now handled gracefully, marking the backup as failed and allowing future backups to proceed.
* *Fixed memory leak with OpenSSL in Netty:* Resolved a memory leak where `OpenSslEngine` instances were not released after connection closure. The leak stemmed from missing reference count deallocation for `SSLEngine` objects. The fix adds proper cleanup, ensuring SSL engines are released and preventing heap growth in long-lived clusters.
* *Fixed incorrect XSD reference in Docker image:* Resolved an issue where the Docker image embedded 5.3 XSD references instead of 5.4, leading to warnings at startup. The fix updates bundled configuration files to reference the correct 5.4 schema, eliminating unnecessary warnings.
* *Fixed IllegalThreadStateException when evicting HD map entries on TPC threads:* Resolved an issue where using HD memory with eviction enabled on `Thread-Per-Core (TPC)` partition threads could trigger `IllegalThreadStateException` during operations like `putAll`. This occurred due to incorrect thread context checks in `LazyEvictableEntryView`. The fix ensures thread-safe access for eviction logic, preventing unexpected failures during high-throughput operations.
* *Fixed issue with CDC connector filtering out schema change events:* Resolved an issue where schema changes (e.g., `ALTER TABLE`) were silently filtered out by the CDC connector due to internal Debezium message handling. This prevented expected schema change events from appearing in downstream sinks. The fix ensures Debezium `SchemaChangeValue` messages are no longer excluded, allowing full visibility into schema evolution.
* *Fixed inconsistency between map.size() and map.keySet().size() when ExpirationPolicy throws an exception:* Resolved an issue where a discrepancy could occur between `map.size()` and `map.keySet().size()` when an `ExpirationPolicy` threw an exception. This issue was triggered in scenarios where an index was defined for a non-existing field, causing an error during indexing without affecting the storage of entries. The fix ensures that `map.size()` and `map.keySet().size()` remain consistent, even in cases where exceptions are thrown during expiration or indexing.

=== New Features

* [.enterprise]*Enterprise* **User Code Namespaces**: Enable deployment and redeployment of your custom classes. See the xref:clusters:user-code-namespaces.adoc[User Code Namespaces documentation].
* [.enterprise]*Enterprise* **Thread-Per-Core (TPC)**: TPC is now generally available. You can enable this feature on the clients and cluster members for improved performance. See the xref:cluster-performance:thread-per-core-tpc.adoc[Thread-Per-Core (TPC) documentation].
* [.enterprise]*Enterprise* **CPMap**:  Added CPMap as a minimal key-value CP data structure. See xref:data-structures:cpmap.adoc[CPMap documentation].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25802[#25802]

=== Breaking Changes

* The `MergingValue` interface within the SPI package now requires the `getDeserializedValue()` method to be defined within implementations, replacing the `getValue()` definition.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25942[#25942]
* Moved the MongoDB connector to the extensions module, that is, its classes and related dependencies relocated;
if you are using Maven to install the connector, you must add `<classifier>jar-with-dependencies</classifier>` to your `pom.xml`.
Also removed the permissions for MongoDB connector.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25744[#25744], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25701[#25701]
* Method names used as parameters in https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/SecurityInterceptor.html[`SecurityInterceptor`] checks were reviewed and unified into a single place  - class `com.hazelcast.security.SecurityInterceptorConstants`. Some client messages have the method name changed to reflect their purpose better. Some client messages are newly covered by `SecurityInterceptor` checks now. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25020[#25020]
* Renamed the service port for Hazelcast clusters deployed in Kubernetes environments to `hazelcast`.
The previous name, `hazelcast-service-port`, caused member auto-discovery for embedded deployments to fail.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24834[#24834], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24705[#24705], https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24688[#24688]
* Fixed an issue where Hazelcast was not failing fast when a member is started with a blank public address. This has been fixed by introducing a configuration validation
that might break any existing, but invalid, configuration.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24729[#24729]

=== Enhancements

==== SQL/Jet Engine

* Removed the beta annotations from the data connection classes.

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/21546[#21546]
* Added the new user code module (`UserCodeTransforms`) to run user codes in containerized environments. Currently, the module can be used with the Jet engine to create mappings with the user codes. #6464
* Added a new UDP socket connector processor (`StreamUDPSocketP`) which can be used as a streaming source.
It accepts a transform function to be applied to the body of the datagram packet before moving it to downstream. #6161
* Aligned the behavior of `hashCode()` method of `KeyedWindowResult` with that of `Map.Entry`. #697
* Boxing of partitionId is now avoided in the `getPartitionAssignment()` method when the partition pruning is not used. #486

* Added support for `DataSerializable` serialization to Mongo connector.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25197[#25197]
* Check for existing resources for Mongo connector is now done only once; previously, it was performed on every processor.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24953[#24953]
* Hazelcast JDBC connector now supports Microsoft SQL server.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25071[#25071]
* Added the ability to configure the pool size of a MongoDB data connection. See xref:sql:mapping-to-mongo.adoc#creating-a-mongodb-mapping[Creating a MongoDB Mapping].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25027[#25027]

==== Data Structures

* Added check for negative positions on the collections' `getItemAtPositionOrNull()` method.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25672[#25672]
* Introduced a cluster state check to improve the removal of expired map/cache entries from the cluster.
The removal operation is no longer executed if the cluster is in passive state.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24808[#24808]
* Added the `IMap.localValues()` and `IMap.localValues(Predicate)` methods for a faster access to locally owned values in maps.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24673[#24763]
* Added the `deleteAsync()` for maps to asynchronously remove a provided map entry key.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/23509[#23509]
* Fixed the Javadoc for caches where it was referring incorrectly to statistics instead of management, for the `setManagementEnabled()` method.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/22575[#22575]
* Implemented RAFT lifecycle interfaces for CPMap. #6800
* Added the `getCPObjectInfos()` method to create a snapshot of all existing CP objects for a given service on the group leader. #615
* Added the `getCPGroupIds()` method to the CP Subsystem API to allow listing all data structures within a CP group. #591
* The "last update time" record of the map entries recovered from the disk persistence is not used anymore when calculating the entries' expiration times. #233
* [.enterprise]*Enterprise* Added the ability to check whether the `ADVANCED_CP` feature is present in the Hazelcast Platform Enterprise license, to enable CPMap. #157

==== [.enterprise]*Enterprise* WAN Replication

* Improved dead connection handling for WAN replication static IP discovery, by introducing health check to the discovery strategy.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25364[#25364]
* Added support for the dynamic adding of WAN replication configurations using Java API.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25118[#25118]
* Added support for evicting map and cache entries through WAN replication by introducing two new properties. When enabled, WAN replication
events are fired when values are evicted from the map and cache objects. See xref:wan:tuning.adoc#replicating-imap-icache-evictions[Replicating `IMap`/`ICache` Evictions].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24941[#24941]

==== [.enterprise]*Enterprise* Security

* Added the ability to check map permissions before suggesting a schema. If a client has permission to read a map, then a suggestion with schema is sent. Otherwise a warning that no
permissions to read maps have been set is generated.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/26058[#26058]
* Updated permission checks in `CacheCreateConfig` and `GetSemaphoreType` tasks.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25529[#25529]
* Improved the permission checks in the file connectors by adding a method that returns the permissions required to resolve field names.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25348[#25348]
* Added support for permission subtraction (deny permissions) in client connections. See xref:security:native-client-security.adoc#deny-permissions[Deny Permissions].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25154[#25154]
* Added the boolean `forceCertValidation` property to the security configuration to initiate a remote certificate validity check. #6235

==== Storage

* Improved the hit/miss cache statistics counter performance.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25146[#25146]
* [.enterprise]*Enterprise* Tiered Store can now be used with map loaders.

* Added the ability to configure Tiered Store backed maps dynamically. #670
* [.enterprise]*Enterprise* Added the ability to persist namespaces for Hot Restart. #402

==== Networking

* Added the ability to evaluate priorities while picking member addresses; when interfaces are not configured, the first possible IP address is no longer used. Instead, all addresses are evaluated and the one with the highest priority (IPv6 address) is selected.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25305[#25305]
* Added the `demoteLocalDataMember()` method to convert members holding data to lite members, enabling a cluster to be alive while there is no data in it.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24617[#24617]
* Improved the duration of joins by the clients to the cluster; the clients can now join instantaneously without waiting by internally delaying the migrations asynchronously.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17582[#17582]

==== Serialization

* Added the ability to use consistent serialization service for `ByKey` plans.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25631[#25631]
* Serialization service is not created anymore for light jobs as it creates overhead and generates garbage. #235, #449

==== Cloud

* Enhanced the warning message shown in the cases of incorrect configurations when deploying a Hazelcast client on Amazon EKS.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/25568[#25568]

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24716[#24716]
* Added the `size` and `sizeBytes` metrics for CPMap. See xref:ROOT:list-of-metrics.adoc#cp-subsystem-metrics[CP Subsystem Metrics]. #6807
* Added the `connectionHealth` and `failedTransmitCount` metrics to WAN Replication. xref:ROOT:list-of-metrics.adoc#wan-replication-metrics[WAN Replication Metrics]. #848
* Added metrics for the User Code Namespaces feature and set the prefix for these metrics as `ucn`. #745, #625
* Removed the stack trace for WAN connection exception since its content was the same as the exception log itself. #578
* Added the ability to collect job execution metrics only from the members which run the job. #194

==== Events and Listeners

* Added the `onCancel()` method to the reliable message listener to trigger a notification when the listener is cancelled for any reason. #286

==== REST API

* Added the new `RestConfig` tag under the server `Config`; it allows configuration of the new REST API server. #508
* Added the health check endpoints for the new REST API; these include state of the members and cluster, and the member count. #192

==== Distribution

* Improved the binary scripts of Hazelcast Platform for Windows operating systems.
** `common.bat` has been updated to not include excessive spaces in parameters.
** `hz-cli.bat` and `hz-start.bat` have been updated to reference the `common.bat` script with correct paths.
