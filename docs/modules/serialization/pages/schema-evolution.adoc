== Introducing schema evolution
:description: This topic introduces schema evolution in Hazelcast Compact serialization and explains how to safely evolve object schemas across rolling upgrades, clients, and persisted clusters without data loss or downtime. It covers backward and forward compatibility, deterministic writes, versioned maps, MapStore and persistence considerations, SQL and index evolution, and best practices for zero-downtime migrations in distributed environments.

{description}

Schema evolution refers to the ability of Hazelcast to handle changes in the structure of serialized objects without requiring downtime, full data reloads, or strict synchronization across cluster members and clients.

In distributed systems, data structures evolve as applications change. You might need to add a field to a class, widen a type, or modify a nested record. In traditional serialization formats, these changes can cause deserialization failures or inconsistent reads when old and new members coexist. Hazelcast Compact serialization resolves these challenges through **schema evolution**, enabling smooth coexistence of multiple schema versions for the same object type across the cluster.

Schema evolution in Hazelcast focuses on three goals:

1. **Backward compatibility:** New members can read data written by old members.
2. **Forward compatibility:** Old members can read data written by new members, ignoring unknown fields.
3. **Operational continuity:** Schemas evolve without invalidating stored data, map entries, or persisted state.

Hazelcast achieves this through Compact serialization, which stores object schemas as independent metadata and identifies each version using a unique 64-bit fingerprint. When an object changes, Hazelcast detects the new schema automatically, assigns it a distinct fingerprint, and propagates it across the cluster. As a result, multiple versions of a class can safely coexist and interoperate during rolling upgrades, migrations, or client refreshes.

While most schema changes can be made safely, **backward incompatibility** may occur when a change prevents old readers from interpreting previously written data correctly. This typically happens in cases such as field renames (changing a field’s name rather than adding/removing it), narrowing a type (for example, `long` to `int`), altering a field’s semantic meaning, or modifying the partitioning key used for data routing. When backward incompatibility is introduced, migration strategies must be applied—such as deploying a temporary pipeline or migration job to transform existing data, introducing versioned maps (`Order_v1`, `Order_v2`), or scheduling controlled rollouts with data export and reimport. These approaches ensure data integrity and consistent behavior during cluster upgrades or schema transitions.

| Term | Definition

| `Schema`
| The structural definition of a serialized object, including its field names and types.

| `Schema Evolution`
| The process of changing a schema over time (adding, removing, or modifying fields) while maintaining compatibility with previous versions.

| `typeName`
| A unique, stable identifier associated with the Compact type. It binds all schema versions for a given logical class.

| `Fingerprint`
| A 64-bit identifier derived from the schema definition using a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_fingerprint[Rabin Fingerprint] algorithm. Any change to a schema produces a new fingerprint.

| `Backward Compatibility`
| The ability of newer code (reader) to correctly read data serialized by older code (writer).

| `Forward Compatibility`
| The ability of older code (reader) to correctly read data serialized by newer code (writer), ignoring unknown fields.

| `FieldKind`
| The internal representation of a field’s data type in Compact serialization (e.g., `INT32`, `STRING`, `DECIMAL`, `ARRAY_OF_INT64`).

== Core principles and strategies

Schema evolution in Hazelcast is guided by a set of core principles designed to ensure that data changes remain predictable, compatible, and easy to manage across rolling upgrades, mixed client versions, and persistent clusters.

=== Stable `typeName`

Each Compact type is identified by a `typeName`, which must remain stable throughout the lifetime of a class.
The `typeName` forms the logical link between different schema versions of the same object. Changing it effectively creates a new Compact type, isolating the data written under the old schema.

Maintaining a stable `typeName` allows new and old members to exchange data transparently, because Hazelcast treats each version of the same `typeName` as an evolution rather than a different entity.

=== Deterministic writes

Hazelcast derives a schema fingerprint from the fields written in the serializer’s `write` method.
The structure and order of these writes must be **deterministic** — meaning they do not depend on runtime conditions or object state.

Conditional writes, skipped fields, or dynamic field names can lead to multiple fingerprints being generated for logically identical objects, causing unexpected deserialization errors or redundant schema registrations.

To ensure deterministic writes:

* Always write all defined fields, even if their values are `null` or default.
* Avoid conditional or state-dependent logic inside the `write` method.
* Keep field names and their corresponding `FieldKind` stable between releases.

=== Schema evolution approaches

Hazelcast supports two primary approaches to managing schema evolution, depending on operational needs and compatibility requirements.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Approach | Description

| **Single Map Evolution**
| All schema changes occur within the same map and `typeName`. This approach allows members to coexist using different schema versions during rolling upgrades. It is suitable for additive or compatible changes (for example, adding new fields, widening types).

| **Versioned Maps**
| Each schema version is stored in a separate map (for example, `Order_v1`, `Order_v2`). This pattern isolates incompatible changes such as field renames, type narrowing, or semantic changes. Data can then be migrated using a pipeline or map-to-map transformation before decommissioning the older map.

|===

Choosing between these two strategies depends on the degree of backward compatibility required.
In general:

* Use **Single Map Evolution** for additive, backward-compatible changes.
* Use **Versioned Maps** for incompatible or semantically breaking changes.

=== Compact schema propagation

Each Compact schema version is identified by its fingerprint and propagated automatically across the cluster when new data is written.
Members and clients cache these schemas locally and can fetch missing versions on demand.
This mechanism allows heterogeneous environments, where not all members are upgraded simultaneously, to continue operating safely during rolling upgrades or failover scenarios.

=== Consistency and partitioning

When Compact-serialized objects are used as map keys, any change to the fields that participate in partitioning (for example, the key field or composite key fields) alters the data distribution across the cluster.
Such changes are considered **incompatible** and require migration or rekeying.
Hazelcast treats these as structural rather than schema-level changes, and they must be handled through data transformation pipelines or controlled rebalancing processes.

== Decision flow for schema changes

When evolving Compact-serialized objects, different kinds of changes have different effects on compatibility and runtime behavior.
This section helps determine whether a change is **safe**, **requires caution**, or **is incompatible** and needs migration.

=== Overview

Schema changes fall into five broad categories:

1. Adding or removing a field
2. Changing a field’s type
3. Renaming or changing the meaning of a field
4. Evolving nested records or collections
5. Changing partitioning keys

Each category has different implications for Compact serialization, compatibility, and data migration.

=== Decision table

[cols="1,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Change | Compatibility | Recommended Action | Notes

| **Add a field**
| Backward and forward compatible
| Keep the same `typeName` and map
| Old readers ignore the new field; new readers should check for field existence before reading.

| **Remove a field**
| Forward compatible only
| Keep the same map; handle missing fields in readers
| Old readers expect the field, so set default values during deserialization.

| **Widen type** (for example, `int` → `long`, `float` → `double`)
| Backward compatible
| Keep the same map; verify all readers can handle the new type
| Widening increases precision; existing data can be read safely by new members.

| **Narrow type** (for example, `long` → `int`)
| Incompatible
| Create a new map and migrate data
| Narrowing can truncate data or cause deserialization errors.

| **Rename field** (for example, `customerId` → `accountId`)
| Incompatible
| Create a new map and run a migration pipeline
| Renamed fields appear as new fields to old readers; original data is not mapped automatically.

| **Semantic change** (same field, different meaning)
| Incompatible
| Create a new map and migrate data
| Schema compatibility does not cover meaning; migration ensures correctness.

| **Nested record changed** (add field to nested record)
| Compatible
| Keep same map
| Nested Compact types evolve like top-level ones; fingerprints differ but interoperate.

| **Nested record renamed or structurally altered**
| Incompatible
| Migrate to a new map
| Treat nested type changes as separate schema evolutions.

| **Collection element type changed** (for example, `List<String>` → `List<Long>`)
| Incompatible
| Create a new map and migrate
| Element type changes alter schema fingerprints and cause read errors.

| **Partitioning key change** (key field renamed or recomputed)
| Incompatible
| Create a new map with new key structure and migrate data
| Partitioning affects data placement; must not change within the same map.

|===

=== Example: Applying the decision flow to `Order`

The following example illustrates how the `Order` type evolves across versions, showing which changes are compatible and when migration is required.

==== V1 — Initial version

The initial version defines a simple `Order` record.
All fields are written deterministically with a stable `typeName`.

[source,java]
----
package com.example.order;

import com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.compact.*;
import java.math.BigDecimal;

public record Order(long id, long customerId, BigDecimal amount, String status) {}

final class OrderSerializer implements CompactSerializer<Order> {

    @Override
    public String getTypeName() {
        return "com.example.Order"; // stable across compatible versions
    }

    @Override
    public Class<Order> getCompactClass() {
        return Order.class;
    }

    @Override
    public void write(CompactWriter w, Order o) {
        w.writeInt64("id", o.id());
        w.writeInt64("customerId", o.customerId());
        w.writeDecimal("amount", o.amount());
        w.writeString("status", o.status());
    }

    @Override
    public Order read(CompactReader r) {
        long id = r.readInt64("id");
        long customerId = r.readInt64("customerId");
        var amount = r.readDecimal("amount");
        var status = r.readString("status");
        return new Order(id, customerId, amount, status);
    }
}
----

==== V2 — Add a field (compatible change)

In version 2, the `currency` field is added.
This change is **additive** and both backward and forward compatible:

* Old readers ignore the new field.
* New readers check for the field’s existence before reading.

[source,java]
----
package com.example.order;

import com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.compact.*;
import com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.FieldKind;
import java.math.BigDecimal;

public record OrderV2(long id, long customerId, BigDecimal amount, String status, String currency) {}

final class OrderV2Serializer implements CompactSerializer<OrderV2> {

    @Override
    public String getTypeName() {
        return "com.example.Order"; // same typeName (compatible evolution)
    }

    @Override
    public Class<OrderV2> getCompactClass() {
        return OrderV2.class;
    }

    @Override
    public void write(CompactWriter w, OrderV2 o) {
        w.writeInt64("id", o.id());
        w.writeInt64("customerId", o.customerId());
        w.writeDecimal("amount", o.amount());
        w.writeString("status", o.status());
        w.writeString("currency", o.currency());
    }

    @Override
    public OrderV2 read(CompactReader r) {
        long id = r.readInt64("id");
        long customerId = r.readInt64("customerId");
        var amount = r.readDecimal("amount");
        var status = r.readString("status");

        // read optional field if present
        String currency = "GBP";
        if (r.getFieldKind("currency") == FieldKind.STRING) {
            currency = r.readString("currency");
            if (currency == null) currency = "GBP";
        }

        return new OrderV2(id, customerId, amount, status, currency);
    }
}
----

This evolution requires no migration.
Both V1 and V2 data can coexist in the same map, and clients continue to read and write normally.

==== V3 — Breaking change (requires migration)

Version 3 introduces two incompatible changes:

* The field `customerId` is renamed to `accountId`.
* The partitioning key changes to use `(accountId, id)`.

These changes make the schema **backward incompatible**, so the new version uses a different `typeName` and a separate map.

[source,java]
----
package com.example.order.v3;

import com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.compact.*;
import java.math.BigDecimal;

public record OrderV3(long id, long accountId, BigDecimal amount, String status, String currency) {}

public record OrderKeyV3(long accountId, long id) {}

final class OrderV3Serializer implements CompactSerializer<OrderV3> {

    @Override
    public String getTypeName() {
        return "com.example.OrderV3"; // new typeName to isolate schema
    }

    @Override
    public Class<OrderV3> getCompactClass() {
        return OrderV3.class;
    }

    @Override
    public void write(CompactWriter w, OrderV3 o) {
        w.writeInt64("id", o.id());
        w.writeInt64("accountId", o.accountId());
        w.writeDecimal("amount", o.amount());
        w.writeString("status", o.status());
        w.writeString("currency", o.currency());
    }

    @Override
    public OrderV3 read(CompactReader r) {
        long id = r.readInt64("id");
        long accountId = r.readInt64("accountId");
        var amount = r.readDecimal("amount");
        var status = r.readString("status");
        var currency = r.readString("currency");
        return new OrderV3(id, accountId, amount, status, currency);
    }
}
----

Because the schema and partitioning key have changed, the new version must be stored in a new map, for example, `orders_v3`.
Existing data from `orders` must be migrated explicitly.

==== Migrating from V2 to V3

Use a Jet pipeline to transform and rekey data from `orders` (V2) to `orders_v3` (V3).

[source,java]
----
package com.example.order.migration;

import com.example.order.OrderV2;
import com.example.order.v3.*;
import com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.*;

public final class OrdersToV3Migration {

    public static void run(HazelcastInstance hz) {
        Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();

        p.readFrom(Sources.<Long, OrderV2>map("orders"))
         .map(e -> {
             OrderV2 v2 = e.getValue();
             long id = v2.id();
             long accountId = v2.customerId();   // renamed field
             return Util.entry(
                 new OrderKeyV3(accountId, id),  // new partitioning key
                 new OrderV3(id, accountId, v2.amount(), v2.status(), v2.currency())
             );
         })
         .writeTo(Sinks.map("orders_v3"));

        hz.getJet().newJob(p).join();
    }
}
----

==== Verification and cleanup

After migration:

1. Verify record counts and key distributions between `orders` and `orders_v3`.
2. Update client applications to use `orders_v3`.
3. Remove or archive the old map after validation.

==== Summary

* **V1 to V2:** Additive, compatible change: same map and `typeName`.
* **V2 to V3:** Rename and partitioning change: incompatible, new map and migration required.
* Stable `typeName`s, deterministic writes, and explicit migration steps ensure safe schema evolution and predictable behavior.

== Integrate schema evolution with MapStore

When a map is backed by a MapStore, schema evolution affects both the in-memory data and the external persistence layer.
Coordinating schema changes with MapStore operations and migration pipelines is critical to prevent data loss or inconsistency during upgrades.

=== Compatible schema changes

For additive or type-widening changes (for example, adding a `currency` field):

* Keep the same map and `typeName`.
* Allow old and new members to coexist during rolling upgrades.
* Ensure the new MapStore implementation can **read old records** and **write the full superset of fields**.
* Default missing fields deterministically when loading data (for example, `currency = "GBP"`).

This approach allows MapStore to act as a bridge between schema versions until all members are upgraded.

=== Incompatible schema changes

For backward-incompatible changes, the existing map and external store cannot safely hold mixed data.

In these cases:

* Create a **new map** (`orders_v3`) with a new `typeName` and a corresponding `v3` MapStore implementation.
* Use a **Jet pipeline** to migrate data from the old map to the new one.

=== Synchronising MapStore and migration pipelines

When both the MapStore and Jet pipeline operate on the same target map, the order of operations determines which value persists.
Understanding how these mechanisms interact helps ensure predictable outcomes.

* **MapStore Loading:**
If a key is not in memory, Hazelcast may call the MapStore’s `load` or `loadAll` methods to fetch it from the external system.
Once loaded, that entry resides in memory until evicted or updated.

* **Pipeline Writes:**
When a Jet pipeline writes to a map (using `Sinks.map`, `Sinks.mapWithMerging`, `Sinks.mapWithUpdating`, or `Sinks.mapWithEntryProcessor`),
it overwrites the value for that key in memory.
The operation _should_ be idempotent: restarts or retries do not create duplicates.

**Conflict resolution rules:**

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Scenario | Behavior

| Key not yet loaded by MapStore 
| Hazelcast first loads the value from the external store, then the pipeline overwrites it. 

| Key already in memory 
| The pipeline overwrites the in-memory value and may trigger a `store` if write-through is enabled. 

| MapStore loading and pipeline writing simultaneously 
| The operations are serialized by Hazelcast on the same key and last one wins.

|===

If conflict resolution is required (for example, partial field merging or conditional updates), use:

* `Sinks.mapWithMerging()` with a merge function, or
* `Sinks.mapWithEntryProcessor()` to apply custom merging logic.

=== Migration pipeline with continuous synchronization

The migration pipeline copies all existing entries from the old map to the new map and keeps the new map up to date
by consuming updates from the source map’s event journal until old clients are removed.

[source,java]
----
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();

// Step 1: snapshot existing entries (batch)
...
// Step 2: stream updates (journal)
...
// Step 3: write both to the same sink
...
----

This migration approach:

* Migrates all existing records once the MapStore has finished loading.
* Streams subsequent updates via the event journal, keeping the new map in sync.
* Ensures no data is lost while old clients are still writing to the old schema.

When all clients have switched to the new version:

1. Stop writes to the old map.
2. Cancel the migration job.
3. Validate record counts and consistency.
4. Retire or archive the old map.

=== Zero-downtime migration summary

* Use additive schema changes wherever possible.
* For incompatible changes, use a new map and MapStore implementation.
* The pipeline overwrites any loaded or existing value: implement merging if required.
* Continue synchronizing through the event journal until legacy clients are retired.
* Optionally validate data integrity before removing the old map.

== Integrate schema evolution with Near Cache

When Near Cache is enabled on a map or client, Compact’s schema evolution does not affect Near Cache behavior.

Each Near Cache entry is stored as a serialized binary representation of the object, typically in the client or member process that owns the cache.
Because Near Cache is scoped per map, its lifecycle and contents are isolated from other maps and schemas.

When schema changes are introduced, old clients continue using their existing map (for example, `orders`), while new clients may use either the evolved records in the same map or a new map (for example, `orders_v3`).
Since each map maintains its own Near Cache, cached data remains valid and operations continue normally.

In summary:

* Near Cache entries are independent per map and unaffected by schema changes in other maps.
* Old clients using the original schema continue to operate with their existing Near Cache.
* New clients use their own cache for the evolved schema or new map.

== When persistence is enabled

When Hazelcast Persistence (Hot Restart) is enabled, Compact schemas are stored alongside the map data.
Each record references the exact schema fingerprint used when it was written, allowing Hazelcast to restore the cluster to its previous state after a restart.

=== How it works

* Hazelcast saves both the binary data and the Compact schema definitions to disk.
* On restart, the same schemas are loaded before the data is restored.
* Every schema is identified by a 64-bit fingerprint — this must match between shutdown and restart for recovery to succeed.

If class definitions change but the fingerprints differ, Hazelcast cannot deserialize the persisted data.

=== Compatible schema changes

Additive or type-widening changes (for example, adding a new field) are compatible with persisted data.

* Old entries remain readable.
* New entries use the updated schema.
* Hazelcast persists all known schema versions, allowing both to coexist safely.

You can perform safely rolling upgrades without clearing persistence when changes are backward compatible.

=== Incompatible schema changes

For incompatible changes (for example, field renames, type narrowing, or new partitioning keys),
the old data on disk cannot be read by the new schema.

In these cases:

* Create a **new map** for the new schema (for example, `orders_v3`).
* The old map keeps its existing persisted data and schema.
* The new map starts clean with its own persistence store.
* Migrate data at runtime using a Jet or SQL pipeline if needed.

Because each map has its own persistence directory, the old and new schemas remain completely isolated —
there is no conflict between them.

Alternatively, delete the persistence directory and reload the map via MapStore or other means.

== SQL and mapping evolution

When using Hazelcast SQL, schema evolution affects how queries, field names, and mappings behave.
SQL mappings define how a map’s key and value structures are exposed as columns.
When Compact schemas change, you may need to evolve these mappings to reflect new or renamed fields.

=== Compatible schema changes

For additive or type-widening changes, existing mappings and queries continue to work without modification.

* Existing fields remain accessible under the same column names.
* New fields can be added to the mapping at any time.
* Queries that don’t reference the new field continue to work unchanged.
* New fields become queryable as soon as new entries using the extended schema exist.

Example:

[source,sql]
----
-- Existing queries continue to work
SELECT id, customerId, amount FROM orders;

-- Querying a newly added field
SELECT id, currency FROM orders WHERE currency = 'GBP';
----

If you define explicit columns in your mapping, update it to include the new field:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE MAPPING orders
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
  'keyFormat' = 'bigint',
  'valueFormat' = 'compact',
  'valueCompactTypeName' = 'com.example.Order'
)
COLUMNS (
  id BIGINT EXTERNAL NAME "this.id",
  customerId BIGINT EXTERNAL NAME "this.customerId",
  amount DECIMAL EXTERNAL NAME "this.amount",
  status VARCHAR EXTERNAL NAME "this.status",
  currency VARCHAR EXTERNAL NAME "this.currency" -- new field
);
----

No data migration is needed; the schema extension is handled automatically at runtime.

=== Hitting old records after recreating a mapping with new fields

When you update an SQL mapping to include an extra field that did not exist in older Compact schemas, queries over **old records** behave predictably:

* **Missing fields read as `NULL`.**
If a row’s underlying Compact schema has no such field, the column resolves to `NULL` at query time. This is schema-on-read; it does not error.

* **Filters and expressions follow SQL three-valued logic.**
Predicates like `WHERE currency = 'GBP'` will **exclude** rows where `currency` is `NULL`. Use `IS NULL`, `COALESCE`, or explicit backfill if you want different behavior.

* **Aggregations handle `NULL`s normally.**
`COUNT(currency)` ignores `NULL`s; `COUNT(*)` counts all rows; `SUM`/`AVG` ignore `NULL`s.

* **Type must be compatible across versions.**
If you widened the type (e.g., `INT` → `BIGINT`), SQL will unify correctly. Narrowing across mixed rows can fail and should be avoided or migrated.

=== Incompatible schema changes

Backward-incompatible changes (for example, field renames, type narrowing, or new key structures)
require a new map and a new SQL mapping.

Example: evolving `orders` to `orders_v3`, renaming `customerId` to `accountId` and introducing a composite key.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING orders_v3
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
  'keyFormat' = 'compact',
  'keyCompactTypeName' = 'com.example.order.v3.OrderKeyV3',
  'valueFormat' = 'compact',
  'valueCompactTypeName' = 'com.example.order.v3.OrderV3'
)
COLUMNS (
  accountId BIGINT EXTERNAL NAME "__key.accountId",
  id BIGINT EXTERNAL NAME "__key.id",
  amount DECIMAL EXTERNAL NAME "this.amount",
  status VARCHAR EXTERNAL NAME "this.status",
  currency VARCHAR EXTERNAL NAME "this.currency"
);
----

Old queries continue to work on the old map (`orders`), and new queries can target the new map (`orders_v3`).

[source,sql]
----
-- Old schema
SELECT id, customerId, amount FROM orders;

-- New schema
SELECT id, accountId, amount FROM orders_v3;
----

Each versioned map has its own mapping and query surface, so schema incompatibility never breaks existing queries.

=== Using Views for a stable SQL layer

If you want to expose a single SQL interface while migrating between versions, create a VIEW that merges both schemas:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW orders_latest AS
SELECT id, customerId, amount, status, currency FROM orders
UNION ALL
SELECT id, accountId AS customerId, amount, status, currency FROM orders_v3;
----

Applications can query `orders_latest` without needing to know which schema version is active.

== Index evolution

Schema changes can affect how indexes are defined and used.
This section explains when you can keep existing indexes, when you must recreate them, and how to handle indexes during migrations.

=== Compatible schema changes

Additive or type-widening changes (for example, adding `currency` or widening `int` → `bigint`) do not invalidate existing indexes on unchanged fields.

* Indexes on old fields continue to work.
* You may add new indexes for newly introduced fields at any time.

=== Incompatible schema changes

Backward-incompatible changes (field rename, removal, type narrowing, or new key structure) require new index definitions aligned with the new schema.

* **Field rename/removal:** drop the old index and create a new one on the new field.
* **Type narrowing:** avoid in place; migrate to a new map and define indexes there.
* **Partitioning/key change (e.g. composite key):** create indexes on the **new map** only.

[NOTE]
====
Indexes are scoped per map. Versioned maps (for example, `orders` and `orders_v3`) hold independent index metadata; define indexes separately for each.
Create these indexes on the **target map first** (so queries are efficient as data arrives).
====

== Caveats and warnings

* Compact fingerprint is not guaranteed to be stable across different versions of the Compact protocol or across language versions. The schema compatibility is indeed tied to the Hazelcast cluster version.
* When persistence is enabled, Hot Restart stores schema definitions in the same directory, but version mismatches can also occur if the cluster version changed and a Compact protocol version has been upgraded.
* Certain field kinds (e.g. ARRAY_OF_COMPACT, COMPACT) have restricted evolution semantics (cannot change element kind or switch between nullable/non-nullable).
* With Compact serialization, when a field is missing, Hazelcast provides type-specific defaults (0, false, null). This is relevant in cases when fields are removed.
