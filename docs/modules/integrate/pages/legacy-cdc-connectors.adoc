= Legacy CDC Connector


NOTE: This page refers to Hazelcast's {open-source-product-name} CDC connectors, also known as legacy CDC connectors. For more information on {enterprise-product-name} CDC connectors, see xref:integrate:cdc-connectors.adoc[].

Change Data Capture (CDC) refers to the process of observing changes
made to a database and extracting them in a form usable by other
systems, for the purposes of replication, analysis and many more.

Change Data Capture is especially important to Hazelcast, because it allows
for the _streaming of changes from databases_, which can be efficiently
processed by the Jet engine.

The implementation of CDC in Hazelcast {open-source-product-name} is based on
link:https://debezium.io/[Debezium, window=_blank]. Hazelcast offers a generic Debezium source
that can handle CDC events from link:https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/index.html[any database supported by Debezium, window=_blank].
However, we're also striving to make CDC sources first class citizens in Hazelcast,
as we have done already for MySQL and PostgreSQL.

== Install the CDC connector

This connector is included in the full distribution of Hazelcast {open-source-product-name}.

== CDC as a source

We have the following types of CDC sources:

* link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/cdc/DebeziumCdcSources.html[DebeziumCdcSources, window=_blank]:
  a generic source for all databases supported by Debezium
* link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/cdc/mysql/MySqlCdcSources.html[MySqlCdcSources, window=_blank]:
  a specific, first class Jet CDC source for MySQL databases (also based
  on Debezium, but with the additional benefits provided by Hazelcast)
* link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{os-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/cdc/postgres/PostgresCdcSources.html[PostgresCdcSources, window=_blank]:
  a specific, first class CDC source for PostgreSQL databases (also based
  on Debezium, but with the additional benefits provided by Hazelcast)

To set up a streaming source of CDC data, define it using the following configuration:

[source,java]
----
Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create();
pipeline.readFrom(
    MySqlCdcSources.mysql("customers")
            .setDatabaseAddress("127.0.0.1")
            .setDatabasePort(3306)
            .setDatabaseUser("debezium")
            .setDatabasePassword("dbz")
            .setClusterName("dbserver1")
            .setDatabaseWhitelist("inventory")
            .setTableWhitelist("inventory.customers")
            .build())
    .withNativeTimestamps(0)
    .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
----

For an example of how to use CDC data, see the xref:pipelines:cdc.adoc[] tutorial.

=== Fault tolerance

CDC sources offer _at least once_ processing guarantees. The source
periodically saves the database write ahead log offset for which it has
dispatched events and in case of a failure/restart it will replay all
events since the last successfully saved offset.

Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the last saved offset
is still in the database changelog. Such logs are always finite and,
depending on the DB configuration, can be relatively short, so if the CDC
source has to replay data for a long period of inactivity, then there
can be data loss. With careful management, the _at least once_ guarantee can be practically implemented.

== CDC as a sink

Change data capture is a source-side functionality in Jet, but Hazelcast also
offers specialized sinks that simplify applying CDC events to a map, which gives you the ability to reconstruct the contents of the original database table. The sinks expect to receive `ChangeRecord`
objects and apply your custom functions to them that extract the key and
the value that will be applied to the target map.

For example, a sink mapping CDC data to a `Customer` class and
maintaining a map view of latest known email addresses per customer
(identified by ID) would look like this:

[source,java]
----
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(source)
 .withoutTimestamps()
 .writeTo(CdcSinks.map("customers",
    r -> r.key().toMap().get("id"),
    r -> r.value().toObject(Customer.class).email));
----

[NOTE]
====
The key and value functions have certain limitations. They can be used to map only to objects which the Hazelcast member can deserialize, which unfortunately doesn't include user code submitted as a part of the job. So in the above example it's OK to have `String` email values, but we wouldn't be able to use `Customer` directly.

If user code has to be used, then the problem can be solved with the help of the User Code Deployment feature. Example configs for that can be seen in our xref:pipelines:cdc-join.adoc#7-start-hazelcast-jet[CDC Join tutorial].

Although User Code Deployment has been deprecated, the replacement User Code Namespaces feature does not yet support Jet jobs or pipelines. For now, continue to use the User Code Deployment solution in this scenario.
